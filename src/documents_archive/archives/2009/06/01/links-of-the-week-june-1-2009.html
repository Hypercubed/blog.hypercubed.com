At one time I posted links each week (2 1/2 years ago... wow it HAS been a while). This was a very manual process. I'd summarize the various links that I bookmarked/tagged throughout the week and add short comments to each. I'd try to add something unique to insure my blog was not just a list of links that can be more easily found elsewhere (example: <a href="http://www.digg.com/">digg</a>, <a href="http://delicious.com/">delicious</a>, <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a>, <a href="http://www.mixx.com/">Mixx</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Buzz!</a>, etc, etc, etc). This process was tedious and boring. Soon real life got more "exciting" (aka difficult) and the links of the week fell through the cracks... as did most of my blogging efforts. So while I've been tagging, bookmarking, and sharing links via Google Reader (<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/02007929937730424974">proof</a>) I have not been summarizing them here on my blog. Well, now 2 and and a half years later it is time to try again.
<p> Thanks to the <a href="http://www.googletutor.com/shared-items-post/">Shared Items Post WP plugin</a> each week all the links I have shared via Google Reader will be summarized on my blog. Some will have comments, some will not. Some will be relevant, some will not. I apologize in advance for the mediocrity of this but it is all I have time for these days. I hope someone finds these useful.

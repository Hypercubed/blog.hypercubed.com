I remember in <del datetime="2009-06-26T03:37:25+00:00">1982</del> 1983 while walking down the street the local bully beckoned me into his house.  I don't know why I went.  I thought for sure I was going to get beat-up bad.  Instead we sat together and watched the new Michael Jackson video... Thriller.  He most likely kicked my ass the next day.

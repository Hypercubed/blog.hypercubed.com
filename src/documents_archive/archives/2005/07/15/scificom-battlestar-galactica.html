<div style="clear:both;"></div>I pretty much only watch two things on TV which is hardly worth my cable bill. The rest of my free time I'm either online or with my son. I watch G4's <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/index.html">Attack of the Show</a> daily and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/" rel="tag">Battlestar Galactica</a> weekly. Battlestar has been in reruns lately but season two premieres tomorrow today (Friday July 15th). If you haven't been watching Battlestar I really suggest you check it out. I consider it one of the best sci-fi TV series' of all time. If you want to get into it now a good start is to go to <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">SciFi's Battlestar site</a> where you can stream, for free, the season one finale. I have to hand it to Sci-Fi for this. I really think this a great way to get people into this series once they see the quality of the episodes.<br /><p>[Edit: Great plot summary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2003)">here</a>]</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

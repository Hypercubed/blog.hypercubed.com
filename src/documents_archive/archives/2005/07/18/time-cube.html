<div style="clear:both;"></div>Maybe I'm late on this but I just ran across Gene Ray's <a href="http://www.timecube.com/">TimeCube</a> website (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_cube">wikipedia</a>). I love everything cubic (especially Hypercubic) but this site is so whacked. It is some sort of rambling of a deranged lunatic with a wacky ass theory of everything. His theory is basically that everything is cubic (whatever that means). I mean this guys is so damn off it is insane.... literally.It would be impossible for me to go through all his theories and debunk them. Not because they are true but because they are incoherent (and awfully formatted). Plus we all know the theory of everything is that everything is hypercubic! Just for fun here is my fictitious argument with Gene Ray:<br /><br /><font style="font-size:180%; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><b>I think Cubic, I am wisest. You think self, you are evil.</b></font><br /><br />Well, I think Hypercubic so I am wiser then you, Mr. Ray. If you are R and I am H then R=X^3 but H=X^4 which means H=R^4/3 so I am you to the 4/3 power.<br /><br /><b><font style="font-size:180%; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I will give $1,000.00 to any person who can disprove 4 days in each earth rotation.</font></b><br /><br />How about starting with the definition of a day according to<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary">MW</a>: "The period of rotation of a planet (as earth) or a moon on its axis". You can keep the money for your psychology bills.<br /><br /><font style="font-size:180%; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">I am not allowed to lecture at the word animal academic institutions, for they fear my wisdom will expose and indict the pedant hirelings as betrayers of dumb-ass students - the dung heads who allow their freedom of speech to be suppressed without a whimper, unbelieveable. Word animals will feel the wrath of Cubic curse.</font><br /><br />Maybe because we word animals know your are dung head schizophrenic lunatic.<br /><br /><font style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-size:180%;">My wisdom so antiquates known knowledge, that a psychiatrist examining my behavior, eccentric by his academic single corner knowledge, knows no course other than to judge me schizoprenic. In today's society of greed, men of<u>word illusion</u>are elected to lead and wise men are condemned. You must establish a<u>Chair of Wisdom</u>to empower Wise Men over the stupid intelligentsia, or perish.</font><br /><br />Thank you. Proof that you have been diagnosed schizophrenic. Well, I'm Hyperphrenic... beat that!<br /><br /><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153); font-size:180%;"><u>There is no human entity</u>, just human Cubics - as in 4 different people in a 4 corner stage metamorphic rotation - never more than 1 corner at same time.</font><br /><br />Does that mean that you and I are the same person? But I proved above that I am you to the 4/3 power. I think that means we are both 1 (1^4/3 = 1) or is it zero (0^4/3 = 0).<br /><br /><font style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-size:180%;">Nature has no choice but to bring forth a hell upon evil cubelessness. Know it to be of your own making.</font><br /><br />Again you are simply wrong by a power of 4/3. Cubelessness is evil, Cubeness is evil^3, convert to Hypercubism or you will bring forth hell upon your self. Hell, exists is a place we can't reach, namely a forth direction or dimension. That is where hell resides and will come forth from a forth direction.... you've been forth warned.<br /><br /><font style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-size:180%;">A mother and baby are the same age, as a 1 day old baby has a 1 day old mother.</font><br /><br />Ok, I have to hand it to you Mr. Ray for this one. I agree entirely.<br /><br />Honestly the mother quote is pretty good. Think about it. If you want even more fun take a look at the guys HTML. Played havoc in my WYSIWYG editor (outlook) when quoting it.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

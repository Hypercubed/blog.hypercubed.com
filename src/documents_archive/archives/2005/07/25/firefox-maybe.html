<div style="clear:both;"></div>So if you follow internet related news you know all the buzz these days is <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/15/2234223&tid=154&amp;tid=1">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/04/18/firefox_is_1_boing_b.html">Firefox</a>, and <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/firefox" rel="tag">Firefox</a>. Personally I never really got the point. I had been using Netscape back in the days, then when IE started being included in windows (anti-competitive or good business?) I switched to IE because it was simply easier. Not to long ago I examined the <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> browser and found it so-so. It was a decent alternative to IE but what is the point of switching if they are almost equal? So being neither a MS fanboy nor a MS-hater what is in it for me by switching to Firefox?<br /><br />So I thought I'd give <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" rel="tag">Firefox</a> it a try. My first impression is that it is a fast browser, has decent rendering on par with IE, and the tabbed system is nice. Then I checked the memory usage. It appeared that Firefox was using more memory then the same page IE. Well I think that is to be expected. With IE some of it's functionality is most likely hidden in other parts of windows, thus "hiding" the memory usage. Look <a href="http://jayseae.cxliv.org/2005/04/24/firefox_memory_usage.html">here</a> for a more detailed analysis of Firefox memory usage compared to IE. You will also see that Firefox is a memory hog that refuses to return it. Again I ask what is so good about Firefox?<br /><br />So I didn't give up right away. I see that there is a book urging users "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596009399/hypercubed-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1">Don't Click on the Blue E!</a>" that claims that Firefox will allow users to "browse faster, more securely, and more efficiently". Haven't see faster yet and don't know how it could possible be more secure. I see some efficiency improvement thanks to the tabbed browsing but from what I understand <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/05/16/417732.aspx">IE7 will have tabs</a>. Is Firefox just a good alternative until IE7 arrives?<br /><br />So why should I switch to Firefox? Well, <a href="http://www.switch2firefox.com/whyswitch/">here</a> is a website that to give me 10 reasons to switch.<br /><ol><li>Tabbed Browsing: See above.</li><br /><li>Popup Blocking: Maybe I missed something but my IE on XP has this same feature.</li><br /><li>Find Stuff Easier: Ahhhh.... Yes. The search feature in Firefox is nice. But it is almost exactly the same as I had in IE with <a href="http://toolbar.a9.com/">A9 Toolbar</a> installed.</li><br /><li>Simplified Privacy / Annoyance Eliminator: This is nice you can view cookies and such but did I really need to know that Amazon set a cookie to "KJHDKLQUWBCMNZUI"?</li><br /><li>Better Bookmarks and History: The bookmark manager is nice but I had no issues with the IE method of using the favorites folder.</li><br /><li>Accessible, Intelligent, Responsive: A bunch of shortcut keys I'll never use.</li><br /><li>Customizable and Extendable: This is really cool. Extensibility in Firefox is off the hook. If I just look at the shear number of extensions available on their <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/?application=firefox">website</a> I am very impressed.</li><br /><li>Modern Download Manager: So far I've considered this a drawback. When you select "save to disk" from the download dialog box the file is saved to a preset folder. It was a while before I realized that all downloads were being sent to my desktop. Sure you can change this but I'm used to being asked each time I want to download something. Maybe I'll get used to this new method.</li><br /><li>Built for standards: That's right we all need standards. It is nice that Firefox conforms to all the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> standards but Microsoft tends to be a standards setter not a follower. I'm sure when IE7 comes out there will be some fancy features that will only be in IE until an equivalent is incorporated into a standard and then into Firefox. Will developers wait that long? I doubt it. This same sort of thing hurt Netscape.</li><br /><li>KISS (Keep It Simple and Straight-Forward): Not sure what this means. I thought IE was pretty simple. Plus using the same system for file browsing and internet browsing seemed pretty straight-forward a simple to me.</li></ol>I haven't given up yet. I t does seam that Firefox is a good application with more pluses on it's side then IE (for now). I really like the extensibility and the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/inspector/">DOM Inspector</a>. So I'm going to continue to try Firefox. I'm struggling to give it a fair shake and see if some of the issues are the fact that I need to retrain myself. I'm resisting the urge to "Click on the Blue E!" for now but we'll see what happens when IE7 arrives.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

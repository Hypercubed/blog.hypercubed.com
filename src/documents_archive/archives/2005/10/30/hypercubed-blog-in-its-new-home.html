I have moved my blog to <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/">blog.hypercubed.com</a>. I've copied all old posts and comments to the new system. Not only does this move allow me guaranteed future control of the domain (the hypercubed.com domain is mine) but also allows me more flexibility and control. The new blog uses the awesome (and free) <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> application. Look forward to a post soon regarding my experiences installing <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and my overall opinion (preview: very good!). I hope I don't lose an readers... all two of you are very important to me!

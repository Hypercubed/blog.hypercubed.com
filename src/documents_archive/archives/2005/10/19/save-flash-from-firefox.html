The other day I posted an article on <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/index.php/archives/2005/09/27/flash-on-your-desktop/">how to place a flash file for display on your desktop</a>. I mention a couple of methods for saving the flash file to your hard drive. Both methods involve examining the source code to get the flash file URL. Turns out there is a much easier way in Firefox. I'll leave <a href="http://www.cruciallimit.com/blog/?p=20">the details</a> to <a href="http://www.cruciallimit.com/blog/">the source</a> but basically, you can view a list of all media on the page, including flash files, from the "View Page Info" menu. Once you find the appropriate item in the media list there is a "Save AsÂ…" button that allows you to easily store the file to your HD. Very nice stuff.

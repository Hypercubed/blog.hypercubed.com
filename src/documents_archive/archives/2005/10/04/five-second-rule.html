So I recently was caught in a discussion about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_second_rule">five-second rule</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that rule that says if you drop a piece of food on the floor it is ok to eat if you pick it up within 5-seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;One person said that they thought the rule was disproved.&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagreed and said that I thought the rule was proven correct by a high school student science experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a disagreement there is only one thing to do consult the all-knowing oracle or wisdom (that would be Google).&nbsp;&nbsp;So I did the research and discovered that the 5-second rule was proven false but yet true at the same time.<br /><br />High school student Jillian Clarke studied the five-second rule as part of summer internship in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her study won an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize">Ig Nobel Prize</a> for Public Health in 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most literal sense Clarks study disproved the five-second rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark showed that foods dropped on intentionally pre-contaminated tiles (hard surfaces) were contaminated in less than five seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that five seconds has no bearing on the how contaminated the food will get.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you drop your food on a contaminated floor it should not be eaten.<br /><br />So this seams pretty straight forward right?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snopes.com/food/tainted/dropped.asp">Snopes</a> marks this one as an urban myth.&nbsp;&nbsp;But wait a minute!&nbsp;&nbsp;They are missing a vital part of Ms. Clarks study.&nbsp;&nbsp;The details above are from Ms. Clarks 2nd experiment where she intentionally pre-contaminating ceramic tiles with E. Coli, dropped various food products for various amounts of time, and then measured the E. Coli count on the food.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the first part of her experiment (details <a href="http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/sefton092903.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/news/stories/news2467.html">here</a>) Ms. Clark and her team took swab samples of floors at various locations around her campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;They showed that the bacteria levels where not high enough to cause significant contamination of your food product.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that this is more then likely due to the types of surfaces sampled.&nbsp;&nbsp;They measured dry hard surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that soft damp surfaces will have higher bacterial counts.<br /><br />So in the literal sense the 5-second rule as it is stated is correct for some floors.&nbsp;&nbsp;If food that falls on your kitchen floor sits for less then 5-seconds it is, most likely, ok to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Matter of fact if the food is on the kitchen floor more then 5-miniutes it is probably ok to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;But nobody would suggest you apply this rule to food dropped on your damp doggy bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides what doesnt kill you makes you stronger right?

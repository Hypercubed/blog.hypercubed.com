Don't worry Mom I'm not going to reveal any dark family secrets. Rather
I'm looking more for lies that everyone's mother has told them at one
point or another. I guess they are not really lies because my mother
(and your mother) were told these same incorrect facts by their
mothers. I'm talking about old wife's tales. Although I really don't
get the phrase. Why old wives? What about young fathers. I'm sure my
father told me a tale or two. Anyway, on with the subject at hand.<br /><br /><strong>Mom: Don't go swimming for an hour after you eat or you'll get cramps and die.</strong><br />There
has never been a reported case of death due to cramping while swimming.
Muscle cramps in the calves, feet, and hands and oxygen-deprivation
stomach cramps while swimming are not uncommon but have never been
linked to a death. <ul><li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/hourwait.asp">Urban Legends Reference Pages: Old Wives' Tales (Hour Missed Brooks)</a></li></ul><strong>Mom: Don't cross your eyes. They'll get stuck.</strong><br />Intentionally
crossing the eyes is never a cause of strabismus (crossed eyes); the
eyes cannot get &quot;stuck&quot; in a crossed position. <ul><li><a href="http://www.triadpublishing.com/eyecarereports/strabismus-book.htm">CROSSED EYES (Strabismus)</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gaiag3Ds.net/3d.htm">3D Images</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mom: Don't watch TV with the lights off. It will hurt your eyes.</strong><br />In
general you should limit the amount of TV you watch as it can be
harmful to your eyes. However, ophthalmologists generally agree that
watching TV in the dark doesn't cause any more harm than watching TV
with lots of light.</p><p>

<p><br /><strong>Mom: You can't have any of my coffee. It will stunt your growth.</strong><br />There
is no compelling evidence that drinking coffee at a young age can stunt
growth. Matter of fact a 30 year study of coffee drinkers showed no
evidence of repressed growth. </p><ul><li><a href="http://experts.about.com/q/1614/2058493.htm">Coffee: does coffee stunt your growth</a></li><li><a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20030519.html">Will drinking coffee really stunt the growth of children?</a></li></ul><strong>Mom: Don't eat spicy foods. You'll get ulcers.</strong><br />90%
of ulcers are caused by a Helicobacter pylori bacterial infection.
Neither stress nor spicy foods cause ulcers. But in some cases they can
make ulcers worse. <ul><li><a href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/pepticulcers_ez/">What I need to know about Peptic Ulcers</a></li><li><a href="http://www.fiery-foods.com/dave/ulcer.html">Spicy Food Off the Hook as Ulcer Cause--But Is It a Cure?</a></li><li><a href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/diseases_conditions/digestive/ulcers.html">kidshealth.org</a></li></ul><br /><strong>Mom: Eat your carrots. It will improve your eyesight.</strong><br />This
one is debatable. Carrots are a good supply of Vitamin A which is
important for healthy eyesight there is no evidence that eyesight will
improve. <ul><li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/carrots.asp">Urban Legends Reference Pages: Food (Carrots)</a></li><li><a href="http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=102431&amp;catId=100409&amp;tid=100008&amp;p=2">Health myths and debates<br /></a></li></ul><strong>Mom: Put on a coat or you'll catch a cold.</strong><br />Cold
air does not cause a cold people do. A cold is a virus contracted
through contact with other people. The reason for this myth appears to
be that during cold weather people tend to stay indoors more; thereby
increasing personal contact with others.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.hhmi.org/cgi-bin/askascientist/highlight.pl?kw=&amp;file=answers%2Fimmunology%2Fans_023.html">Ask A Scientist - Colds, flu, and temperature</a></li><li><a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/cold.html">www.niaid.nih.gov</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/common_cold.html">OSH Answers: Common Cold</a></li></ul><strong>Mom: Don't play with that toad, you'll get warts.</strong><br />Toads
do not have (or give) warts. Warts are caused by human papilloma virus.
This is a human virus that is not carried or transported by other
animals. The odd bumps on the back of a toad are not warts they are to
help camouflage them in their natural habitat.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.stayinginshape.com/3osfcorp/libv/p37.shtml">OSF Healthcare: Warts</a></li><li><a href="http://yahooligans.yahoo.com/content/ask_earl/page?d=20001123">Yahooligans: Ask Eral<br /></a></li><li><a href="http://www.londondrugs.com/Cultures/en-US/FocusOnHealth/Fall2002/Warts.htm">London Drugs: Putting an End to Warts <br /></a></li></ul><strong>Mom: Don't swallow your gum it will take 7 years to digest.</strong><br />Gum,
or anything else you swallow, will pass typically in a days time.
Swallowing gum is not considered healthy but it definitely won't get
stuck.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/chewgum.asp">Urban Legends Reference Pages: Old Wives' Tales (The Seven Year Glitch)</a></li><li><a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_11_20/ai_n7635455">Men's Fitness: Spit or swallow?

not but mother was closes on this one. There doesn't appear to be any
conclusive evidence either way regarding arthritis but it appears that
there is some weak correlation that knuckle-cracking causes some damage
to the hand.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://elfstrom.com/arthritis/knuckle-cracking.html">Does Knuckle Cracking Cause Arthritis?</a></li></ul>There
you have it. Thanks to the internet we can finally break this long
chain of myths and our children can become the coatless gangs of
caffeinated knuckle cracking cross-eyed kids we always wanted to be.
Oh, yeah.... and whacking it wont make you blind either. <p>&nbsp;</p><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

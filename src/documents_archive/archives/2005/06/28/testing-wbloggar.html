<div style="clear:both;"></div>Ok, just for kicks I'm testing <a href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a>. The HTML editor actually appears to be a little better then BlogJet's but without the WYSIWYG editing. But the good syntax highlighting helps tremendously. Probably best of all for most people is that w.bloggar is free. The image capabilities in w.bloggar are not as good as BlogJet requiring you to upload each image to the FTP site individuality before adding to your post where BlogJet uploads all the images at once when posting. Dragging and dropping text appears to be broken. Amazingly spell checker seams to have the same <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/06/blogjet-follow-up.html">problems as BlogJet</a>.<br /><br />[Note: edited to show correct name of application w.bloggar not w.blogger.]<br /><br /><div align="center"><img height="238" alt="" src="http://www.hypercubed.com/blog/images/wblogger_spell.gif" width="430" border="0" /><br />w.bloggar spell checker</div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div><p>I do a lot of programming. I do it both at work and at home as a hobby. I  program mainly in Visual Basic.NET and FORTRAN<span class=328384117-18062005>  </span>90. I also do some JavaScript (in HTML), VBScript (via ASP), and VBA.  I&#8217;ve done some C and Pascal programming. I know all the hardcore programmers out  there reading this (are there any) are saying to themselves where is C++ and/or  Java. Well, I never program in C++ or Java. I know they&nbsp;<span class=328384117-18062005>both </span>have become the de facto standards in  programming these days but I&#8217;ve never seen the point in climbing their steep  learning curves for what I have to do. The new Visual Basic.NET (which is by the  way <a href="http://visualbasic.about.com/od/learnvsnet/l/blecvbnet10101.htm">10x  better then vb 6.0</a>) has all the fancy object based features you could ever  want (inheritance, polymorphism, etc.) and FORTRAN<span class=328384117-18062005> </span>has the mathematics ability and speed<span class=328384117-18062005> when needed</span>. At home when I'm programming for  fun I want to get right to the part I'm interested in. I don't want to  complicate my life by fighting with the GUI or with pointers. I want to focus on  the part that interests me and that's it. At work I need a programming language  that makes it easy to enter the mathematics I need and will solve the problem  fast. I love FORTRAN<span class=328384117-18062005> </span>for the easy vector  and array manipulations. Each serves it's purpose and very well I think.</p> <p>I&#8217;d wouldn't mind seeing a Fortran/.NET hybrid. Give me Fortran&nbsp;<span class=328384117-18062005>math&nbsp;</span><span class=328384117-18062005>abilities </span>with Visual Basic.NETs object oriented  system.&nbsp;<span class=328384117-18062005>Hopefully we get </span>some of the  OO stuff in the upcoming FORTRAN 2000 (yes, I know they are a little late) but  not everything. Allow me access to the system libraries and Common Language  Run-time along with the cross-language capabilities of .NET. Give me the option  of using FORTRAN fixed format read&#8217;s and writes all packaged in Microsoft's  Visual&nbsp;<span class=328384117-18062005>Studio </span>and I'd be hooked.<span class=328384117-18062005>&nbsp; I've see some attempts to integrate Visual  Studio but they all fall short.&nbsp; Essentially they create a set of function  calls within FORTRAN that send information into VB or C and back.&nbsp;  Basically I want VB.NET for engineers and scientists.</span></p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>In a follow-up to my previous articles on hurricane Katrina and Pat Robertson (<a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/09/katrina-was-caused-by.html">here</a> and <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/09/pat-robertson-blames-katrina-on.html">here</a>) is <a href="http://datelinehollywood.com/archives/2005/09/05/robertson-blames-hurricane-on-choice-of-ellen-deneres-to-host-emmys/"> this</a> article in the prestigious news site Dateline: Hollywood.  According to the article Robertson is now blaming Katrina on the choice of Ellen Degeneres to host the Emmy Awards.  He has a point this time...  he notes that last time Degeneres was chosen to host the Emmys, in 2001, the September 11 terrorism attacks took place shortly before the ceremony. We all know that <a href="http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/posthoc.htm">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a> (after this therefore because of this) is one of the most profound logical arguments known to man.<br /><br /><em>By the way in case you don't get it Dateline: Hollywood is a </em><a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/katrina/robertson.asp">satire</a><em> site.  </em><a href="http://franklinavenue.blogspot.com/2005/09/anatomy-of-internet-rumor.html">Apparently</a><em> many people didn't get it.  But I really don't blame them with Pat's track record.  If you want to read some of his memorable quotes please look </em><a href="http://en.thinkexist.com/quotes/pat_robertson/">here</a><em>.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>I saw this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">meme</a> on <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/a_quickie/">pharyngula.org</a> and thought I would participate just for the fun of it.    But don't worry teh risk of falling into <a href="http://www.mrhelpful.com/archives/000994.html">meme hell</a> is slight.<br /><br />Meme rules:<br />1. Go into your archive.<br />2. Find your 23rd post (or closest to).<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">It happens to be my most popular post: </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/04/visual-studio-cannot-debug-mappoint.html">here</a><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><br />3. Find the fifth sentence (or closest to).<br />4. Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.<br /><blockquote> I could setup the application just fine (see instructions  <a href="http://www.mp2kmag.com/a119--metropolitan.statistical.areas.msa.mappoint.html">here</a>) but for some reason I could never get the runtime debugging to work.</blockquote><br />Interesting.  Most popular post and the root of the problem.  Creepy!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

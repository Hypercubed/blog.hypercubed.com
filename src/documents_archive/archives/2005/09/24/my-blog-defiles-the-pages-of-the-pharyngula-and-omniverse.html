<div style="clear:both;"></div>I just noticed (ok... I noticed a few hours ago, stop nit-picking!) that my blog is listed as a "Weblogs of the Week" over at <a href="http://pharyngula.org/">pharyngula.org</a>.  In the famous (slightly modified) words of Wayne and Garth....<br /><blockquote>[I'm] not worthy! [I'm] not worthy! [I'm] not worthy!</blockquote><br />I was wondering why my daily visits went from around 5 to over 30 in the last few days.  And I thought it was all due to <a href="http://omniverse.blogspot.com/">omni's link</a>. Wow, it really looks like this blogging thing is paying off. I'm going to be rich any time now. Watch out Bill Gates I'm coming for you!<br /><br />All kidding aside thanks to <a href="http://pharyngula.org/">pharyngula</a> and the not-quite-opposite end of the spectrum but kinda-kitty-cornered <a href="http://omniverse.blogspot.com/">ominverse</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p> I've just uploaded version 0.4 of Xinha Here! This is a major update. Not only do I think I've finally squashed a bug that popped up in Firefox v1.5 but I added a options dialog. With the options dialog you can select which features of Xinha you would enabled as well as select the skin. implementing the options dialog was very tricky as it required me to learn XUL (Mozilla's user interface language) as well as some tricky JavaScript to store the settings. Unfortunately I was not able to release this version and remain backwards compatible with pre-1.5 versions of Firefox. If you have an old version you should consider <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">upgrading</a>. Please give it a try and let me know how it works for you.

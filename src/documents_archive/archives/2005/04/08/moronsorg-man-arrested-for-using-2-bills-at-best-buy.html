<div style="clear:both;"></div>We have all had our bad experiences with <a href="http://www.mcgintech.com/marc/BestBuySucks.htm">Best Buy</a> but this poor guy was arrested for using $114 in $2 bills. OK, so he was probably being an ass because the Best Buy employee "misstated" that installation was free but he didn't deserve to be arrested. Next time he should remember Bets Buys policy on customers questions:<br /><br /><blockquote>When asked a question by a customer to which you don't know the answer simply make up whatever answer you need to close the sale. You can always deny it later.<br />- Best Buy Employees Manual ยง254.75 <p></p></blockquote><br />I believe the same policy is in effect at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tarahertz/frys-sucks.html">Fry's electronics</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

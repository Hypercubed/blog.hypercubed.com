<div style="clear:both;"></div>This would never happen in the US.  As a matter of fact I bet if the cola companies and the vendor operators could get away with it the price would increase after a disaster.<br /><br />Another reason it would never work here (maybe not in Japan either) is that I'm sure the first person to reach the machine would take them all and start reselling at inflated prices.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

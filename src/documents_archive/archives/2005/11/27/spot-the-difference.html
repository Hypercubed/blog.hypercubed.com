<p>I saw this ad in the December 2005 issue of Dr. Dobb's
Journal for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/difference/default.aspx">MS spot the difference sweepstake</a>. It asks the viewer to spot the differences between two
images of the same scene.&nbsp; On the left the developer without
Visual Studio and on the right with Visual Studio.&nbsp; The ad claims
&quot;Once you start coding, you'll see it immediately&quot;.&nbsp; It was a good
advertisement as it got my attention as I tried to spot more an more
differences.&nbsp; So good in fact I decided it scan it in an turn it
into a HTML page.&nbsp; Click on the image below and you will get a pop
up with the pre-Visual Studio developer.&nbsp; Mouse-over the image to
see post-Visual Studio.&nbsp; Read the rest of the entry for things I noticed.<br />

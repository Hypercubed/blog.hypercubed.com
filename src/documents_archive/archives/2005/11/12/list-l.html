<p>My blogging has slowed down quite a bit from the days I started. I've
been busy with other projects, family, work, etc.&nbsp; I have plenty
of excuses but lack of content isn't really one of them.&nbsp; Every
week I collect many web links that I think I should share with my
readers (and preserve for myself).&nbsp; I want to avoid the one line
&quot;Here is a great link&quot; post entries but don't always find the time to
write about the links content or attributes or how to add verbiage on
what the link means to me.&nbsp; So I've decided to start a weekly (or
as close to as I can get) post of my collected links.&nbsp; They will
be a collection of links with very short descriptions for your surfing
pleaser.&nbsp; So here is my first collection.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fcmx.net/vec/get.swf?i=003702">Hand drawing of a woman</a> - Flash animation showing an artist drawing a woman from scratch.  Very amazing for a non-artist like myself.</li>

Mills, a Harvard University medic, claims to have discovered a new form

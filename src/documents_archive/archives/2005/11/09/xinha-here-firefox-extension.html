experience installing WordPress</a> I mentioned that I installed the <a href="http://baptiste.us/plugins/xinha4wp">Xinha4WP plugin</a>.&nbsp; I was very 
impressed by the plugin and the <a href="http://xinha.python-hosting.com/">Xinha 
editor</a> itself.&nbsp; The Xinha editor is an offshoot of <a href="http://www.htmlarea.com/">HTMLArea</a> which is an integral part of the <a href="http://www.pd9soft.com/megabbs-support/index.asp">MegaBBS forum system</a> 
I use (and have contributed to).&nbsp; I really feel these little HTML editors are 
very handy and every web developer should include or better yet make it an 
integral part of Firefox.</p>
<p>A day or so later&nbsp; I noticed that Mozilla is running an <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2005-11-3.html">&quot;Extend Firefox&quot; 
competition</a>.&nbsp; That gave me the idea... why not package Xinha as a Firefox 
extension.&nbsp; That way not matter what site I visit I can have my favorite HTML 
editor handy.&nbsp; Most likely not a worthy entry into the contest but an interesting project non the less.<br /></p>
<p>The following weekend (ignoring pleads from my wife to clean the house or 
other such nonsense) I developed what I'm calling Xinha Here!&nbsp; With this extension 
you can add HTML to any textbox or textarea on any website.&nbsp; You simply select 
the textbox (or textarea), right click, and selected Xinha Here!&nbsp; Up will pop a 
Xinha editor for your WYSIWYG pleasure.&nbsp; Press OK and the raw HTML is pushed 
back to the original textbox.&nbsp; Simple as that.&nbsp; I would also suspect that 
because the Xinha source and images are located within the extension (not on the 
web) it may be faster to load then the web version.</p>
<p>Xinha Here! can be downloaded <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">here</a>. Beware that this is my first 
Firefox extension and only version 0.1 so there are bound to be some bugs.&nbsp; I've 
only tested it with Firefox 1.0.7 so your mileage may vary.&nbsp; The current 
implementation doesn't allow any of customization of Xinha.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>

As a recent, and <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/index.php/archives/2005/07/25/firefox-maybe/">initially reluctant</a>, convert to Firefox I feel it is my duty to announce the latest version of Firefox is now available.  If you haven't already I encourage everyone to give Firefox a try.  Once you go Firefox you'll never go back.

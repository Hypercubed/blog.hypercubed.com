<div style="clear:both;"></div>When you enter or leave a room do you even notice using the doorknob. Probably not. That's because it becomes a part of your motor memory. The actions required to use a doorknob are simple enough and you do it often enough that you can perform the actions by rote (i.e. routine and automatic, not requiring conscious thought [my definition]).<br /><br />Every once in a while there is a piece of software that, like the door knob, can become such a part of your motor memory you forget it is even there. That is how it is for me with <a href="http://www.roboform.com/?affid=cubed">RoboForm</a> is a plug-in for your browser (IE and others) that remembers your login information after you login to a password protected site. The next time you visit that site you can have the password filled in for you.<br /><br />I've tried other software that does the same thing (like <a href="http://www.geocities.com/technofundo/tech/web/ie_autocomplete.html">IE auto-complete</a> and <a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/ew/ewallet.htm">eWallet</a> ) and <a href="http://www.roboform.com/?affid=cubed">RoboForm</a> is by far the best. <a href="http://www.bagus-software.de/products/pwsafe/pwsafe.htm">Bagusoft </a><a href="http://www.bagus-software.de/products/pwsafe/pwsafe.htm">Password Safe 3.0</a> is a distant second. I'm not going to go into details of all the features (you can read them <a href="http://www.roboform.com/features.html">here</a>) but simply say that if you want a password storage tool that will not interfere with your daily browsing yet lets you quickly login to your password protected sites then this is the one for you. Install it, use it, and you'll almost forget it is there, like a doorknob.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

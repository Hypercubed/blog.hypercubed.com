<div style="clear:both;"></div>Ok, I'll admit it I was fooled. I was planning on blogging about <a href="http://www.newturfers.com/mwf/attach/38/355838/BBCNEWSWorldLionMutilates42MidgetsinCambodianRing-Fight.htm#lion">this article</a> according to which 42 Cambodian midgets attempted to fight a lion. I was going to suggest that they win the <a href="http://www.darwinawards.com/">Darwin award</a> and bad mouth their leader and the Cambodian government. Well, luckily I didn't because it appears that the whole article was a hoax, I should have known. Well, you should check out <a href="http://lionvs40midgets.uk-directory.com/">this site</a> where the people that created the fake BBC article explain how they made it, how it spread, and how they are attempting to control the hoax. Interesting read.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

It was funny, in a British sort of way, but not <strong>very</strong> funny. I had never read the book(s) and as I was watching I was thinking that this would be much funnier if I were reading it. Soon after that I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345453743/hypercubed-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1">the book</a> and while Im not yet finished I can tell that this is going to be a great ride. The humor in the book is many times more then what was in the movie. I dont regret seeing the movie. As a matter of fact I think seeing the movie first was a benefit. Having watched the movie it gives the book added voice and visuals that might not have been as detailed if I hadnt seen the movie. Ill write more when I finish the book (or the trilogy, which for some reason consists of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345453743/hypercubed-20?creative=327641&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1">five books</a>) but for now Ill leave you with a great quote that you will find in the book but not in the movie (it would never work in the movie):<br /><br /><blockquote><p>youd better be prepared for the jump to hyperspace. Its unpleasantly like being drunk.<br />Whats so unpleasant about being drunk?<br />You ask a glass of water.<br />Authur thought about this. </p></blockquote><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

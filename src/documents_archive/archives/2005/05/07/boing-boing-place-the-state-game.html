<div style="clear:both;"></div>I was never very good at geography in school.  Matter of fact I wasn't good at anything other then math and science.  Anyway, I think I would have defiantly done better if I had this site available to me when I was in school.  <a href="http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/web_games.htm">This website</a> contains several flash based web games geared towards geography education.  The Place the State game is actually really fun.  Makes me realize how little geography I know even today.<br /><br />[Via: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/06/place_the_state_game.html">boingboing</a>]<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

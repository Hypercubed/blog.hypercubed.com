<div style="clear:both;"></div>I like old games. Especially ones that I really wanted to play when I was younger and couldn't afford it (like I mentioned with <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/03/memories-of-zelda.html">Zelda</a>) but are now cheap as hell (try the pre-played section at <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/default.asp">EBGames</a>). It is even better when the games are free. I like to find and play old abandonware games. One of the best sites for abandonware is <a href="http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?id=3022">Home of the Underdogs</a>. Also try searching on Google as many of these sites tend to venture too far into the not-so-abandonedware and get shut down. Another great site is <a href="http://www.replacementdocs.com/news.php">replacementdocs</a> to download old manuals.<br /><br />I'm also attempting to setup a <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> machine. I've got the computer running great using <a href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/readme.html">AdvanceMAME</a> and <a href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/menu-readme.html">AdvanceMENU</a> running under MS-DOS 6.22 and using the DOS version of <a href="http://www.symantec.com/pcanywhere/">pcAnywhere</a> to control it. I did a lot of tweaking of pc's setup including a custom compiled version of <a href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/readme.html">AdvanceMAME</a>. Hopefully soon I get around to blogging all the sweet hacking of my PC to get MAME just right.  In the future I hope to get a cabinet to install everything in and make a standup cab complete with coin slots.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

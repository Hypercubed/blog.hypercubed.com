<div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/publius_ovidius/111672.html">publius_ovidius: Don't fuck with Ovid -- the long version</a><br /><br />In case you haven't seen this.... have a read. It is very interesting.  Apparently this guy caught some identity thieves red handed.  One thing I take out of it is that I really want to get the credit card companies to stop sending those stupid checks.  Does anyone use those anyway?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p>I know, I know.... late again.&nbsp; I'm getting lazy.

  <li><a href="http://www.aharef.info/2006/05/websites_as_graphs.htm">Aharef: Websites as graphs</a> - Application that displays a websites document structure as a graph.&nbsp; The colors stand for different HTML structures such as links, tables, and DIVs.&nbsp; Not very well suited for the color blind (like myself) but interesting none the less. 
  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.aprilzero.com/?blog/comments/web_workflow_part_i/">April Zero | Web Workflow - Part I</a> - Interesting writeup describing how to design a website form scratch from pen and paper to HTML with a little photoshop in the middle.&nbsp; Personally I start with the back end programming first (the most interesting part for me) and work on the design later. &nbsp;

  <li><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/060522-robots_2.html">Mystery Robot Said to Solve Crimes, Find Mines in Chile</a> - This robot seams to defy physics.&nbsp; I wonder if the inventor refuses to patent the design because he knows it will be deemed unsafe.

  <li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/25/opinion/25thu4.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">Why American College Students Hate Science - New York Times</a> - I've always had issues with the way math and science is taught in school.&nbsp; I remember very clearly that up to my sophomore year in high school I hated math and science.&nbsp; I hated math because it was a bunch of busy work that appeared useless.&nbsp; What do I learn from completing 10 pages of triple digit multiplications?&nbsp; "When I grow up I'm going to buy a calculator!".&nbsp; Science was even worse.&nbsp; Boring teachers that obviously had no interest in teaching and arbitrary and stupid grading schemes.&nbsp; The worst of all was the subtle undertones of all these classes.&nbsp; I never heard a teacher say it directly but it was implied that only geniuses understand math and science and I am definitely not a genius.&nbsp; Math and science was something that we were forced to take but never really expected to learn.&nbsp; Somehow despite all this I still eventually found my love for science and math.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm living proof that you don't need to be a genius to&nbsp; understand math and science.

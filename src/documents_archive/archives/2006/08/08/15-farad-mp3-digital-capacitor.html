<a class="imagelink" href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/frys_ad.jpg" title="1.5 Farad MP3 digital capacitor"><img id="image257" align="right" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/frys_ad.jpg" alt="1.5 Farad MP3 digital capacitor" /></a>This little Fry's ad caused a little ruckus among my electrical engineer co-workers.  First a 1.5 Farad capacitor!  That is just huge.  Most capacitors are in the microfarads (millionths of a farad).  From what I understand these large capacitors are used for the soul purpose of ensuring that your car stereo provided maximum pain to ear drums all drivers around you.<p />Second exactly how can a capacitor be digital?  A capacitor is a analog device.. there is no doubt about it (link: <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor.htm">how capacitors work</a>).  There is no such thing as a digital capacitor right? It turns out term "digital" refers to a built-in digital voltmeter on the analog capacitor.  Ok, so I guess this ad is not so strange after all... I mean we all have MP3 playing capacitors laying around our workshops don't we?

<p> Over at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsmarketplace/">Inside Windows Marketplace blog</a> someone (I believe a MS employee) has linked to my website. Normally this would be a good thing. The MSDN blogs get quite a bit of traffic and some of that traffic would bleed over to my page.&nbsp; Unfortunately they didn't include a hyperlink to my site but included a graphic that resides on my site, this is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlink">hotlinking</a>. Now I'm not upset that they are "stealing" my image because (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsmarketplace/archive/2006/08/02/686781.aspx">as you can see</a>) it is simply a screenshot.&nbsp; But their site gets a lot of traffic. Every time they have a visitor their server is telling the the visitors browser to pull the image form my sever. I only noticed because I saw a spike in my traffic and checked my stats to see where the traffic was coming from.  As of this writing serving images to <b>their </b>visitors accounts for 12% of <b>my </b>bandwidth. That is 12% of my costs are paying for them to have visitors. Doesn't seem right does it?  I've sent a fairly friendly note asking the blogger to remove the image. If they fail to comply I'm going to have to take <a href="http://www.maxpower.ca/hotlink-revenge/2006/01/09/">drastic measures</a>.

<p>Because they are linking to an image on my sever I can do what I want with the image.&nbsp; I can delete it so their visitors will see a broken link.&nbsp; I can instruct my sever to block requests from their page (again their visitors will see a broken link).&nbsp; Or more dramatically I can replace the image with porn.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be nice surprise for the MSDN blog readers to see a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse.cx">goatse</a> image (note: this link is to a encyclopedia article discussing a very graphic image, the image is not in the article, safe for work) when visiting the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsmarketplace/">Inside Windows Marketplace blog</a>?

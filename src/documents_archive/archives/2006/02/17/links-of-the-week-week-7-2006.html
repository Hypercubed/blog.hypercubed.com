  <li><a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/">The IT Crowd</a> - This is a hilariously funny UK sitcom involving a couple of corporate IT nerds and their life in the basement.&nbsp; UK residents can view the episodes from the shows <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/">official website</a>.&nbsp; Others will have to search <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">elsewhere</a>.&nbsp; I find it ironic that the IT nerds in the show have plastered their walls with <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2006/02/06/eff_gets_heavy_presence_on_it_crowd.html">EFF</a> and "MP3 Is not a crime" stickers yet the episodes are released DRM crippled.

  <li><a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20060218/mathtrek.asp">Math Trek: Calculating Dogs, Science News Online</a> - Interesting article on how dogs apparently "calculate" complex math problems. Maybe we just need to realize that nature invented math not man and there should be no surprise when nature exhibits seemingly complex math. "Wow, how incredible, bacteria reproduce exponentially... how do they know what <abbr title="2.71828183">e</abbr> is." 
  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.totallycrap.com/media/tunnelaccident/" title="via BoingBoing.com">Tunnel Accidents</a> - I enjoy watching these tunnel car crashes way too much. Maybe it's the super cool euro techo music... yeah that's it. 
  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://flashface.ctapt.de/">Ultimate Flash Face v0.42b</a> - Build your own police sketch. Try to create your own image, if it is that hard for you to create your own face how can a witness remember a criminal? 
  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://mblog.lib.umich.edu/%7Erdivecha/archives/2006/02/the_world_of_sm.html" title="via SlashDot">The World of Smartboards, Sympodiums is about to change</a> - This is a demo of the future of touch screens. Imagine if you could control your computer will both hands and specialized finger movements. 
  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.thanhniennews.com/features/?catid=10&amp;newsid=12673">Vietnam man handles three decades without sleep</a> - I don't know if this is try but this man has supposedly not slept in 33 years after a bad fever. I don't know... sounds nice to me... but maybe I should be careful what I wish for. 
  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.vischeck.com/daltonize/">Vischeck</a> - I think I've mentioned before that I'm color blind. I really hate when people ask me what blue looks like to me. Seriously... think about it. Anyway, if you want to see what it looks like visit this site.

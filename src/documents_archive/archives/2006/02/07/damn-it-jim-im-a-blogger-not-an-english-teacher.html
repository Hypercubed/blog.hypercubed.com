I recently received the following e-mail:
<blockquote>Hi.
  <br />I have just been reading through your blog - I installed your excellent xinha here xpi earlier - great job indeed. You have some interesting content on your blog. My mother was an English teacher and I have an annoying habit of feeling I have to point out mistakes. :) So here I go.
  <p>You keep using the word 'their' instead of 'there'.
    <br />Their = belongs to them
    <br />There = indicates position.
  </p>
  <p>Also, where words are basically made up, such as the verb to zombify, they should be used consistently with words of a similar nature that do exist. For example; to electrify. Something electrifies, not electrifys. Therefore, you should write zombifies, not zombifys. Other than that, keep up the good work. All the best,
  </p>
</blockquote> My response was:
<blockquote>Thank you for your comments. Yes, I do know the difference between their, there, and even they're. I also know the difference between its and it's, effect and affect. I even know that irregardless is not a word. I do, however, have trouble with comma use. In any event if I seriously took the time to grammar check every post I would never get anything done. As it is I rely very heavily on the spell check to catch many mistakes and still many posts take upwards of an hour. Surprisingly, I work as an engineer and my grammar is considerably better then many of my co-workers.
  <p>I thank you but if knowing is half the battle, then I'm satisfied with a tie.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> With more practice perhaps my writing speed will improve and then I can focus more on the details. Untell then please accept my apologies.
</p>
<p>Reminds me of an eirlier e-mail that was not so friendly and seamed almost hostile.
</p>
<blockquote> Credibility comes from attention to detail.&nbsp; Try spelling "copying" correctly on your page.
</blockquote>
<p>At least if you are going to criticize my grammar please be polite!&nbsp;

Lately I've been playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">FreeCell</a>&nbsp;(thanks to <a href="http://surfvi.com/~nandhp/ceproj/freecell/">FreeCell for Pocket PC</a> by <a href="http://nandhp.blogsome.com/">nandhp</a>).&nbsp; I had gotten to the point that I could win every game (with a few undoes).&nbsp;&nbsp;I began to wonder if there was a solution to every game.&nbsp; &nbsp;Turns out FreeCell is one of the most popular solitaire games because it has the one of the highest&nbsp;win rates of any solitaire (see <a href="http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html">FreeCell -- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) written by Michael Keller</a>).&nbsp; There are some deals that are <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~hansb/d.freecell/node2.html#SECTION0002">unsolvable.</a>&nbsp; With this knowledge my game playing strategy changed.&nbsp; I no longer wanted to simply play free cell but actually solve every single game I was presented with.&nbsp; Needless to say this often takes many undoes or a restart.&nbsp; Up to the other day I had solved every one presented to me (about 35 games).&nbsp; Well, I finally hit one that I couldn't solve.... unfortunately it had nothing to do with the deal.&nbsp; The game simply cheated.&nbsp; Take a close look at this screenshot.</p>

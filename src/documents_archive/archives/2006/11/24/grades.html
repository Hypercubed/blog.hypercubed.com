  <br />(10-99 blogs linking in the last 6 months)
  <br />This contrasts somewhat with the [B-list bloggers], which enjoys an average age not much older than the first at 260 days and which posts 50% more frequently than the [B-list bloggers]. There is a clear correlation between posting volume and Technorati authority ranking.

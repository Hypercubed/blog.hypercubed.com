Here are your links of the week. Late this time because... well.. I just didn't feel like it.
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.carotids.com/lifestyle/health-problems-related-to-the-geek-lifestyle/">Health Problems Related to the Geek Lifestyle - Carotids.Com</a> - A discussion by a "board-certified Internal Medicine physician" on the health risks of the geek lifestyle. Most of them appear to be related to sleeping problems. Let's see it is 1:28, I'm tired, but instead of sleeping I'm writing these links of the week. Maybe there is something to this.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/30/news/newsmakers/gates_howiwork_fortune/">How I Work: Bill Gates - Apr. 4, 2006</a> - Article by Bill Gates on how he works. His computer is setup with three monitors. On the left his e-mail list, middle the e-mail he is currently reading, and on the right a browser. I don't know about you but if I had only that open on my desktop all day I'd be fired.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2006/04/05/maryland-countys-red-light-cameras-net-2-85-million-increase/">Study: Maryland county\'s red light cameras net $2.85 million, increase accidents - Autoblog</a> - I've always wondered if the red-light cameras are doing more harm then good. Well apparently in at least on county it has sparked a 40% increase in rear end collisions while raking in 2.85 million in fines. I wouldn't doubt if the local officials are already planning to expand the program.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sas.org/tcs/weeklyIssues_2006/2006-04-07/feature1p/index.html">The Citizen Scientist</a> - Ok, we all know that most, if not all, major social and economic problem in the world today can be somehow related to overpopulation. We also know that the problem is going to get worse as the population continues to grow exponentially. That said nobody would hope for a plague to whip out 90 of the earth's human population... would they? Apparently one guy is and some applauded for his opinion.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">TPCI - TIOBE Programming Community Index</a> - I've just recently discovered the joys of PHP (4th most popular programming language). I've also recently added C++ (3rd) to my knowledge base joining to Basic (5th), JavaScript (9th), VB.net (16th) and FORTRAN (21st). All great languages in my opinion. What I don't get is why Java is the most popular. What was the last time you rand a commercial application written in Java (for me... never)? When was the last time you visited a webpage with Java (for me it was last time my browser crashed)? I just don't understand the fascination with Java especially considering that most implementation of it (that I've seen) were crap.

  <li><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/03/0328_060328_bears_video.html?source=rss">Video: Bear's-Eye View Shows Scuffle and Snacking</a> - Very cool National Geographic clip on attaching a video camera to a bear's neck. See a bear's life first hand.

<p>With much delay I'd like to present version <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">0.10 of Xinha Here</a>.&nbsp; You will notice that the version number remains a subversion.&nbsp; I had hoped (for the last six months) to clean up the last few things that we keeping me from calling it 1.0 but with the recent release of <a href="http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0/releasenotes/">Firefox 2.0 RC1</a> I felt it was necessary to put out a compatible version.&nbsp; This version is mostly some clean-up.&nbsp; I've added tool tips to the editor, fixed a little bit of weirdness when opening and closing the bottom bar, and I've improved the about box.&nbsp; One nice change is that you can now hold shift while selecting "Open Xinha Here" to have the text in the text box is treated like plain text rather then HTML.&nbsp; This will preserve your line spacing and tabs.&nbsp; I also integrated Xinha Here more tightly with <a href="http://spellbound.sourceforge.net/">SpellBound</a> by adding a Spell-check button.

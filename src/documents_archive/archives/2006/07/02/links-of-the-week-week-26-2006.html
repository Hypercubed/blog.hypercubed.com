This has always been an interesting topic for me. I remember one of my first history reports in elementary school was on the development of written language... I got a decent grade but the teacher informed me that it wasn't considered history.&nbsp; I always had trouble deciding what was considered history.&nbsp; I once wrote a history report on King Author (fictional character) told through dialog.

I first I thought my site was wiped off the internet map.&nbsp; But no, my sites were still accessible.&nbsp; Then I thought that maybe on of the sites that link into mine had dropped me but I couldn't figure out which one.&nbsp; Eventually I gave up and accepted the fact that nobody likes Hypercubed anymore.&nbsp; Turns out it was due to the sudden adoption of Alexa toolbar by a huge number of Digg users.&nbsp; Suddenly, overnight, the Alexa rankings were altered by the new demographic.&nbsp; Tech sites shot up and non tech sites shot down.&nbsp; I always considered hypercubed a tech site... guess I was wrong.&nbsp; Next week I'm going to have all cute kitten links.

I doubt I'll ever get a free-after-rebate power strip again (at least from OfficeMax or Best Buy).

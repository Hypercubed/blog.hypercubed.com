<p>One reason that I have a blog (in addition to the desire to share technical information) is that I want to practice writing.&nbsp; One of the most difficult things about writing is <a href="http://www.write101.com/lethamfind.htm">finding voice</a>.&nbsp; Before I start writing my posts I first plan the post in my mind.&nbsp; I structure the paragraphs, sentences, and words and plan out the tone, rhythm, and flow of each sentence in my head.&nbsp; Unfortunately when I start to put the words on paper, or should I say on screen, that voice is mysteriously lost.&nbsp; The tone and rhythm are dulled.&nbsp; It is almost like being tone deaf.&nbsp; I hear the song correctly in my head but when it comes out it is off tone.

  <br />So how can I find my voice? &nbsp; The answer is simple, in theory, but difficult to implement: practice, practice, practice.&nbsp; I have tried to keep a private journal but that has always failed.&nbsp; When I try to write privately the quality is extremely poor.&nbsp; What I write tends to be stream of consciousness type of writing with disconnected and incoherent thoughts.&nbsp; It ends up like a personal note with no voice at all.&nbsp; So I blog.&nbsp; I blog because it keeps me honest.&nbsp; If I think that people are reading what I write then I strive for more.&nbsp; I'm actually talking to a person rather then taking notes for myself.&nbsp; Now the problem with this is that now that my blog has some readership (70 poor souls stumble in here each day) I have developed a sort of performance anxiety.&nbsp; I want to post something, anything, everyday if I could but I also want to make sure that I write something worth reading.&nbsp; I decided long ago that I do not want to write about my personal life.&nbsp; So instated I blog about technical issues.&nbsp; But their are just not enough technical issues to keep me going.&nbsp; So I end up doing what I'm doing today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blogging about blogging.

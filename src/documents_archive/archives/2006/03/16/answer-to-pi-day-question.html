<p>Ok, now for the answer to the <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2006/03/14/pi-day/">Pi Day question</a>. The answer is: 
<br /><!--more-->Neither. Both values are the same.</p>
<p>How?&nbsp; Well I gave the hint that 3.14159... is exactly equal to <font face="times new roman,times,serif">π</font>. The dot-dot-dot (...) means a continuation of the numbers in the sequence of Pi.&nbsp; This is not that hard for people to understand or believe.&nbsp; If one were to write out the digits of Pi you would be writing a number approaching Pi.&nbsp; The more digits you write the closer you are to Pi but never exactly there.&nbsp; In order for the decimal number to be equal to Pi you need to write all infinite digits of Pi.&nbsp; The dot-dot-dot is just a short hand for all the infinite digits of Pi.
  <br />
</p>
<p>Now what about 0.9999...?&nbsp; This is much harder for people to grasp  even though it is based on the same principle (it was difficult for me at first as well).&nbsp; If you were to write 0.9999 followed by continuing digits of 9 you would be writing a number approaching 1 but never really reaching it.&nbsp; 0.9999... however is an infinite number of nines.&nbsp; Can one write infinite nines?&nbsp; No, but what what would infinite nines mean?&nbsp; Well, infinite nines is exactly 1 just like 3.14159... is eactly Pi, not a number approaching it.
  <br />
</p>
<p>So if 0.9999... is exactly equal to 1 then 0.9999… / 3.14159… = 1/<font face="times new roman,times,serif">π</font> = <font face="times new roman,times,serif">π</font><sup>-1</sup>.  Both values are equal.
</p>
<p>Ok, don't belive that 0.9999... is equal to one? Try this:
</p>
<pre>Let               x = 0.9999...
Then            10x = 9.9999...
And         10x - x = 9.9999... - 0.9999...
Reduces to       9x = 9
With the solution x = 1 </pre>
<p>Therefore 0.9999... is exactly equal to 1. Don't belive me? <a href="http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.0.9999.html">Ask Dr. Math</a>.

  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone.html">Apple - QuickTime - Download - Standalone QuickTime Player</a> - Have you had to install QuickTime lately? I did and I was surprised that the QuickTime download site only offers QuickTime with iTunes 6.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I don't need iTunes I just want to see a .MOV file.&nbsp; Good luck finding QuickTime alone.&nbsp; Well you are in luck... I found it.

A movie that <a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html">had been discussed previously by Skeptico</a>.

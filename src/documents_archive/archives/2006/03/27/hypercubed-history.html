Yesterday I discussed the history of the hypercubed blog.&nbsp; The Hypercubed Blog is only one year old (as of yesterday) but I've been running my own website in one form or another for many years.&nbsp; My first site was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocities">Geocities</a> way back in 1996 or so. I eventually got tired of the their advertisements being shown on "my" site so I switched to my own pay&nbsp; account.&nbsp; My URL at that time was http://www.concentric.net/~labtek/ (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970107021315/http://www.concentric.net/%7Elabtek/">Internet archive is available</a>). I ran what I called Labtek's Laboratory and Labtek's Physics Forum. Labtek's Physics Forum was not a forum at all but really just a set of physics related links.&nbsp; This was before Google so finding stuff on the web was a little more difficult in those days.&nbsp; This entire site was coded by hand in a text editor.&nbsp; Matter of fact the only dynamic portion of my site was a simple perl based guest book.&nbsp;&nbsp; Labtek's Laboratory served it's purpose at the time... giving me experience with HTML and web design. 
<p>In 2000 I purchased <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.hypercubed.net">hypercubed.net</a>.&nbsp; I wanted my own domain so that I can run my website with out the worry of changing hots and therefore URLs.&nbsp; I took the .net domain because hypercubed.com was taken at that time. This was my first full URL.&nbsp; Soon after purchasing hypercubed.net the hypercubed.com URL became available so I snagged that one up also.&nbsp; I hosted these URLs on a windows server and created my entire site using ASP with a clunky templating system consisting entirely of &lt;!-- include --&gt; statements.&nbsp; I tried for a while to use this site to resell web hosting and provide site design.&nbsp; I'd like to point out that this was a time before everyone and their brother was a web host reseller and/or designer.&nbsp; I soon discovered that without any real value added services my "customers" would be better off hosting directly to my host.&nbsp; My website design fees were pretty cheap for those days but other web designers started to readjust their prices in response to the bursting .com bubble.&nbsp; I quit the business before I made any real money.&nbsp; So with two URLs and no business what the point of hypercubed.com. Well, I started to use hypercubed.com as a projects website. If I developed something I thought was neat I created a page on my site to show it off.&nbsp; Problem with this was that each time I added a page I needed to make it fit into the hierarchical structure of my website.&nbsp; Under this structure most of the pages were hard to find and it seamed a bit awkward but there was really no alternative I could think of at the time. That was how websites were back then.

<p>In 2005 I still had hypercubed.com running but I decided to try out this blogging thing.&nbsp; Yes, I was late, very late.&nbsp; Blogging had already come and was in the middle of peaking.&nbsp; Better late then never so I jumped on the band wagon.&nbsp; I started running <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com">hypercubed blog</a> and posting all my little computer recreations to the blog.&nbsp; This is great because I don't have to worry about where to put each item in my websites structure.&nbsp; Rather then being hierarchical and project based a blog is chronological.&nbsp; It works, it makes sense.&nbsp; Why didn't I think of it sooner?&nbsp; I may have arrived late on the blogging scene but it was what hypercubed.com was supposed to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

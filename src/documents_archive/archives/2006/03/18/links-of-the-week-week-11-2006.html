  <li><a href="http://www.hccamsterdam.nl/brickfactory/index.htm">LEGO(c) Building Instructions and Catalogs</a> - When I was little I loved LEGOs.&nbsp; The problem was all I had was a two or three boxes of the small sets (12 pieces or so).&nbsp; I was frustrated that I couldn't build what I wanted to because I had so few pieces.&nbsp; One Christmas I decided that all I wanted was LEGOs and nothing else.&nbsp; When anyone would ask me what I wanted for Christmas I said LEGOs and refuse to give alternatives.&nbsp; I thought for sure I was going to get a few of the big LEGO sets.&nbsp; Well, I was only half disappointed.&nbsp; I did get LEGOs but instead of a few big sets I received dozens of tiny sets.&nbsp; Ok fine, I can deal with that.&nbsp; I ripped open all the boxes and placed all the pieces in a bucket for easy access.&nbsp; Before I realized what had happened my parents had through away all the "discarded boxes". &nbsp; Unfortunately along with them were all the instructions.&nbsp; So I finally had all the pieces I could ever want and I couldn't build a single thing "by the book".&nbsp; From then on if I needed a simple car I would make it by looking at the picture in the LEGO catalog and inferring the design.&nbsp; Not very easy.&nbsp; If this site were around then it would have relieved some of my childhood trauma.

  <li><a href="http://curdrice.com/ranga/red_rain.html" title="via Digg.com">Red Rain Proof of Extraterrestrial Life?</a> - I believe with absolutely no doubt there is extraterrestrial life somewhere.&nbsp; I'm less certain of the idea that they have ever visited here or if they are even close enough for us to ever communicate in any way.&nbsp; There are many people that really want to prove that there is extraterrestrial life so much so that I think they find "evidence" where it doesn't exist.&nbsp; This site (and the linked scientific paper) have pictures of what is reported to be biological cells found in the rain from the red rain phenomenon Kerala, India.&nbsp; From what I read the only clues they have to justify claiming these cells to be biological is that they look like cells and they are made of carbon.&nbsp; I'm sorry but that is not enough for me.&nbsp; The cells don't appear to have any type of nucleus and test for DNA found no traces.&nbsp; The only way that these particles looks like cells is that have an oval shaped and has a hard "cell wall" (crust).&nbsp; It looks like a tiny exotic type of carbon based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geode">geode</a> to me.&nbsp; Given that the appear source of these particles was a meteoroid it doesn't seam that implausible.&nbsp; I could be wrong.&nbsp; I'm not the expert looking at all the data but it does look like a little wishful thinking to me.

  <li><a href="http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/19980907140525data_trunc_sys.shtml">Ten Obscure Factoids Concerning Albert Einstein</a> - I often see people try to latch on to how they are similar to famous people; especially Einstein.&nbsp; They are employing a logical fallacy although it is unspoken and inferred.&nbsp; I'm a horrible speller.&nbsp; But you know what... so was Einstein.&nbsp; The inferred statement is that I am a genius like Einstein.&nbsp; Well, in my case it may be true but in general I'm sure most bad spellers are not geniuses.&nbsp; Well, Einstein also smoked and hated Science Fiction so I guess I'm not a genius.

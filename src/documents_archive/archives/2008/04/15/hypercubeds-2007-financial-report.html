<p><a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image1.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="352" alt="image" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image-thumb1.png" width="162" align="right" border="0" /></a> In <strike>condemnation</strike> celebration of tax day here in the US of A, I will now fully disclose Hypercubed's 2007 financial statement.&#160; In 2007 Hypercubed received $72 in 6 semi-anonymous donations via PayPal.&#160; The largest donation was $25 received from [name withheld] in support of Xinha Here development.&#160; These donations were burdened with $4.15 in transaction fees resulting in a net donation income of $67.85 (thank you all).&#160; In addition, Hypercubed blog received $200 from affiliate marketing.&#160; This one-time windfall cash influx is attributed to a single purchase of services from <a href="http://services.superb.net/affiliate.php?affiliate=683&amp;url=superbhosting.net/dedicatedservers">superb hosting</a> by a Hypercubed blog reader that may have accidentally clicked the Superb Hosting affiliate banner then subsequently decided to purchase $1000 worth of services from Superb.&#160; Revenue from all other affiliate marking efforts were either non-existent or below the threshold necessary to received payments.&#160; In total Hypercubed's total net revenue for 2007 was $267.85. </p>  <p>Hypercubed paid $239.40 in hosting fees to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058|HYPERCUBED50">DreamHost, Inc</a>.&#160; These hosting fees were paid in 2007 for services to be rendered through 2009.&#160; Hypercubed paid an additional $39.80 in domain name registration fees.&#160; In total Hypercubed's expenses in 2007 were $279.20. </p>  <p>So all told my little hobby here has cost me $11.35 in 2007.&#160; Not bad considering how expensive alternative hobbies can be ($2500 for a camera, my god!).&#160; I could probably squeeze a little more out of this by strategic placement of ads and posting more often but, like I've said before, this is a hobby not a living.</p>

<p><strong><em>Please see the update at the end of this post.</em></strong></p>  <p>I'm in the market for a new PC.&#160; One of the machines I'm considering is the Dell XPS 420.&#160; Dollar for dollar the XPS 630 looks like the better deal but the 420 is still in the running (as is building my own).&#160; While looking at what Best Buy has to offer online I noticed for the first time that they sell Dell machines including a couple of XPSs.&#160; I had no idea that best sold Dells.</p>  <p>The best buy site is <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8781703&amp;type=product&amp;id=1205026863692">offering</a> a XPS 420 for $899.99 (<a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/dell-420-bb.gif">image here</a> in case it gets changed), only 99 cents more than the base model at <a href="http://www.dell.com/">dell.com</a>.&#160; But wait... that's not the base model.&#160; The one at bestbuy.com is 2.66 GHz quad core, a $200 upgrade to the base model's 2.40 quad core.&#160; It has a 500 GB hard drive, a $50 upgrade to the base model's 320 GB.&#160; It has the ATI RADEON HD 2600 XT upgrade, another $100 addition to the base model.&#160; It also is listed as having a media card reader ($20) and a 56K modem ($20).&#160; All told I priced the equivalent machine on Dell.com for $1,309 (<a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/dell-420-d.gif">image here</a>).</p>  <p>Sounds like a great deal and with a best buy only a block away I decided to take my son for a walk and see this monster in person.&#160; It looked like a nice machine.&#160; I was impressed with it's size (big like I like my PCs).&#160; First thing odd I noticed was that there was no media reader.&#160; Ok, then I opened the system properties dialog and noticed the machine was listed at 2.40 GHz... what?&#160; I didn't look at the other items because I frankly had forgotten.</p>  <p>I then asked a blue shirt for the specs on this machine.&#160; He returned a minute later with a print out from the website.&#160; I told him that the machine is listed as at 2.66 GHz but the display model was only 2.4. GHz.&#160; He brushed it off as a misprint.&#160; I then pointed out the missing media reader.&#160; He then proceeded to look everywhere for the media reader (including inside).&#160; In then end we agreed the website was wrong and that buying it in-store or online will result in the same base setup.</p>  <p>Returning home I see now that two people reviewed this machine online mentioned that they got a 2.4 GHz model.&#160; No mention of the other features.&#160; Surprisingly they all still give good ratings.&#160; I would have been pissed off if I had purchased this machine online and received the base model. </p>  <p>Update (5/18/2008): I managed to take a look at the box for this computer today.&#160; The label on the box lists all the same specs as the website minus the 2.66 GHz processor.&#160; Apparently the only thing missing if this machine if purchased in store or online is the CPU upgrade from 2.40 to 2.66 ($200 value).&#160; The display model in the store, however, is the base model missing all the extras.</p>

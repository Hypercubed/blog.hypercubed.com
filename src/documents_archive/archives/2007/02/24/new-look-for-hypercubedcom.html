<img src="http://www.hypercubed.com/files/animated_logo_trans3.gif" align="right"> <p>Last year when I moved to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058|HYPERCUBED50">DreamHost</a> and made the jump from ASP to PHP I also migrated <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com">www.hypercubed.com</a> from a flat file system&nbsp;to a Content Management System (CMS).&nbsp; A CMS is a system where the pages are stored in a database rather then in files on the server.&nbsp; This allows me to update the web pages directly on the web site rather then than editing the file and uploading it via FTP.&nbsp; This blog for example runs that way.</p> <p>When choosing a CMS the main thing I was concerned about was allowing me to seamlessly integrate CMS's served files with preexisting files on the server.&nbsp; Not only did I want to avoid the utterly nonsensical URLs like /node/q=34 but I also wanted to keep the distinction between a file and a folder.&nbsp; Most CMS's force all URLS to look like a folder rather then a file (i.e. /about/ rather than /about.php or /about.html).&nbsp; </p> <p>At the time I explored Drupal, Joomla, and some other CMS's but in the end decided to simply use WordPress which I was familiar with as my blog platform.&nbsp; WordPress makes a decent CMS but not exactly what I needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I quickly threw together an extension to get the file/folder distinction I wanted.</p> <p>As the year pasted I started to regret this decision.&nbsp; Not because it didn't work but because I felt like I was forcing a square peg into a round hole.&nbsp; WordPress is a blog, not a CMS.&nbsp; Then Drupal 5.1 was released in January so I gave it another try.&nbsp; Drupal 5.1 had everything I needed right out of the box.&nbsp; Setup was easy, customizing the look and feel was easy, finally a real CMS.</p> <p>So if you go to <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com">www.hypercubed.com</a> today you will see my brand new homepage powered by Drupal 5.1.&nbsp; Looks pretty good if you ask me.&nbsp; I think I spent more time on the spinning logo then setting up the sight.&nbsp; Having already converted all my flat files to WordPress last year speed up the migration to Drupal greatly.</p> <p>One thing still bugs me though. Why do I need a blog and a homepage?&nbsp; Many of the information on my home page was really more deserving of a blog entry then a dedicated webpage and only existed on my homepage because I lacked a blog at the time.&nbsp; So in the process of moving to Drupal I deleted some old stuff, move some stuff to my blog, and in the end end up with very little on the homepage.&nbsp;&nbsp; So again... Why do I need a homepage?</p> <p>In the end I figure it like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;My homepage (despite the name) is like my work phone.&nbsp; I would never answer my work phone with "Whatup' Biatches!".&nbsp; My blog on the other hand is my home phone (which I would also never answer like that but you get the point).&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to worry&nbsp;that the first thing&nbsp;people see on my homepage is my latest blog entry discussing <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2006/11/15/frys-quality-service/">cursing fry's employees</a> or an article encouraging people not to <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2005/03/26/dont-fuck-with-ovid/">fuck with Ovid</a>.&nbsp; Sure my blog gets a lot more traffic then my homepage and the distinction is now very thin but I like the separation.&nbsp; I guess you can say that <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com">www.hypercubed.com</a> and <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com">blog.hypercubed.com</a> are my web based equivalent of a mullet... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullet_(haircut)">Business in the front, party in the back!</a></p>

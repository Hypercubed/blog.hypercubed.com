<p>I recently returned from a&nbsp;trip to Japan to visit the in-laws.&nbsp; My father-in-law speaks very little English and I speak even less Japanese so we often communicate though gestures and single words.&nbsp; One day I noticed a very cubic looking stained glass lamp shade he had made (stained glass is a hobby of his).  That gave me an idea.&nbsp; With a little help from my mother-in-law, who speaks very good English, I showed him a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube">hypercube</a> (ok, it is really as 3-D shadow of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract">tesseract</a> but let's not get technical).&nbsp; I don't think he fully understood what a hypercube was (then again nobody does) but he was interested.&nbsp; So we sat together and worked out the dimension of each piece necessary to make a glass hypercube.&nbsp; It was very nice to have that moment with him... communicating though math.&nbsp; A week after I returned from my trip I received the following picture via e-mail.&nbsp; He made a stained glass hypercube!&nbsp; It looks spectacular.&nbsp; I'm very impressed.</p> <p align="center"><strong><a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/stainedglasshypercube.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="302" alt="StainedGlassHypercube" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/stainedglasshypercube-thumb.jpg" width="400" border="0"></a></strong></p>

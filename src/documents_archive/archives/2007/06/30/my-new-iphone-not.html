  <p>Like any good geek I've been intently watching the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> technolust unfold over the last few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are&nbsp;<del>11</del> 10 reasons&nbsp;I&nbsp;will be sticking with my <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/smart-phones/siemens-sx66-cingular-wireless/4505-6452_7-31256904.html">Siemens SX66</a> for a few more years (if it lasts that long):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I'm cheap as hell!&nbsp; $500 is a lot of money for a phone.&nbsp; If I'm going to pay that much I want it to do everything (see 3-8). </li>
    <li>AT&amp;T (or&nbsp;is it the new hipper at&amp;t)&nbsp;2-year contract requirement.&nbsp; Why&nbsp;on earth do you need to commit to a two&nbsp;year contract with at&amp;t to use&nbsp;a phone that&nbsp;you paid full price for? </li>
    <li>EDGE.&nbsp; I'm not sure about the details but from what I understand the iPhone's EDGE data connection is not very fast compared to the latest 3G technologies. </li>
    <li>No GPS.&nbsp; My Siemens SX66 doesn't have GPS either but then again it didn't cost $500 (see #1).&nbsp; I'd much rather have GPS than that accelerometer. </li>
    <li>Google maps only.&nbsp; Online Google maps should work fine... if you are inside at&amp;t's coverage.&nbsp; What if you are lost in the amazon (<a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/World/20020902amazon0902p2.asp">it happens</a>)?&nbsp; Without cell coverage online Google maps is not going to help.&nbsp; Can't call for help, can't find a map, no GPS to get your heading.&nbsp; Maybe you can use the backside as a emergency reflector? </li>
    <li>No memory expansion.&nbsp; That means in a few years when&nbsp;4GB SD cards are $20 each you'll need to buy a new iPhone for another $500 plus inflation (see #1). </li>
    <li>2-megapixel camera.&nbsp; No I'm not complaining about the low-res camera.&nbsp; I don't want a camera at all.&nbsp; There are many places (including my work) that do not allow cameras.&nbsp; I'm not willing to pay $500 (see #1) for a phone that will sit in my car all day.&nbsp; Plus 2-MP, no flash, and no video... WTF? </li>
    <li>No removable battery.&nbsp; This just seams like a bad idea. </li>
    <li>Will not act as a modem.&nbsp; If the service plan is for unlimited data transfer it would be nice to be able to use your iPhone as a modem for a laptop... especially if it had the faster 3G speeds. </li>
    <li>It's the first version.&nbsp; It looks like Apple did a great job but iPhone 2.0 should be better (*crosses fingers*). </li>
    <li>Did I mention I'm cheap as hell?&nbsp; I guess I did.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Yes, there is a little jealousy here.&nbsp; The iPhone does look like a well made machine and user very friendly.&nbsp; I defiantly wouldn't refuse a free one.&nbsp; Maybe when my Siemens SX66 breaks and my company changes there archaic rules I'll think again.</p>

<p>In Feb. 2006 I <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2006/02/27/new-home/">moved my website to a new server</a>.&nbsp; I moved after nearly 5 years with my previous host.&nbsp; 5 years ago&nbsp;I&nbsp;signed up for a Windows based hosting service (I don't think I should&nbsp;mention the name).&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose this service because it had features I couldn't find elsewhere.&nbsp; I signed up for their "enterprise"&nbsp;service to get all the features I needed.
</p>
<p>For the first couple of years I&nbsp;was happy with the service. Customer service and and the CEO himself were very approachable.&nbsp; I received monthly newsletters from the CEO explaining new features and new hardware upgrade plans.&nbsp; The servers were fast and fairly reliable.&nbsp; When the server would go down a quick e-mail to support would fix it right up.&nbsp; It was everything I needed.
</p>
<p>However, over the years&nbsp;the newsletters stopped and&nbsp;and customer service became more unapproachable.&nbsp; And while other hosting services got better and cheaper my "enterprise" service stayed the same price and&nbsp;features that I liked were taken away.&nbsp; For example&nbsp;anonymous FTP and unlimited e-mail accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Features that I was paying extra&nbsp;for (like domain parking and third level domains) became standard included features in most hosting plans.&nbsp; Eventually I realized my account was no more then a basic low cost hosting account at "enterprise" prices.
</p>
<p>I began to look for alternatives. I noticed that my host now offered "low cost" accounts.&nbsp; Not only were these hosting accounts cheaper they also included "free of charge" many of the features that I was paying extra for with my enterprise account.&nbsp; In other words my hosting provider was offering more for less.
</p>
<p>Trying to be loyal I called my host and requested to switch to their new cheaper plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were less then helpful.&nbsp; I could not change my account to the cheaper hosting but needed to cancel my account with&nbsp;them and open a new account. After 5 years of high end service at a high end price&nbsp;you would think that they could offer me a discount to match the budget hosting fees or something.&nbsp; Out of blind loyalty to my host of 5 years I decided to stick with&nbsp;them and switch to the cheaper service.
</p>
<p>I soon became very disappointed with the quality of service&nbsp;I received with their budget hosting.&nbsp; The technical support staff were not been able to stop periodic shutdowns of my website.&nbsp; I submitted more trouble tickets in my first fours months at with the new cheap hosting then I did in my 5 years with "enterprise" hosting.&nbsp; In addition by this time tech support had moved completely out of the country so all support tickets would take overnight to receive support.&nbsp; I presume because we had to wait for the day shift in India.
</p>
<p>Well, that was the last straw.&nbsp; I packed my bags and moved on.&nbsp; I even ate 8 moths of prepaid hosting fees.&nbsp; After a lot of research I switched to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058%7CHYPERCUBED50">DreamHost</a>.&nbsp; I haven't mentioned <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058%7CHYPERCUBED50">DreamHost</a>&nbsp;before on this blog because I wanted to give them time to suck.&nbsp; Luckily for my they have not disappointed me in the least.
</p>
<p>My up time is&nbsp;great and I&nbsp;don't need to submit tickets on the rare occasion when my sever goes down (they already know, like ESP!).&nbsp; The price is comparable to the budget plan from my previous host&nbsp;plus unlimited domain names and third level domains.&nbsp; And domain registration for 9.95 a year!&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058%7CHYPERCUBED50">DreamHost</a>&nbsp;offers so much bandwidth and storage that my current usage&nbsp;usually reads 0%.&nbsp; And my storage and bandwidth limits increase every week!&nbsp; If <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058%7CHYPERCUBED50">DreamHost</a>&nbsp;keeps up the great work after 5 years&nbsp;I'll have over 1 TB of space.&nbsp; After 5 years with my previous host all I got was shitty service.&nbsp; What can I say... <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058%7CHYPERCUBED50">DreamHost</a>&nbsp;really is Superb!
</p>
<p>This rant is not even half of the great features they offer (do I sound like a sleazy car salesman?).&nbsp; If you decide to signup for <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058%7CHYPERCUBED50">DreamHost</a>&nbsp;enter the promo code: <b>HYPERCUBED50</b> for $50 off.&nbsp; That's right thanks to Hypercubed blog you can get $50 off your&nbsp;first year&nbsp;fees.&nbsp; Aren't I great?

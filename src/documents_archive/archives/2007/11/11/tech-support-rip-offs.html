<p><a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/image1.png"><img style="border: 0px none ; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="image" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/image-thumb1.png" align="right" border="0" height="288" width="224" /></a>Checkout this advertisement from the Sunday paper.&nbsp; Data transfers or data backup services for $99!&nbsp; This is a giant rip-off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the caveats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cannot transfer programs".&nbsp; That means they are not copying your whole hard drive but simply some files from one computer to another.&nbsp; But wait... "Transfer up to 4.7GB of information".&nbsp; Why 4.7GB?&nbsp; Well because that is the size of a single DVD.&nbsp; So for $99 they come to you home or office, copy your My Documents folder to a DVD, then copy that DVD to a second computer.&nbsp; If the transfer takes more than one DVD it will cost you extra money.&nbsp; For that price you can buy your own <a title="Amazon.com: 18X Internal DVD Dual Rw: Electronics" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000JM1BXE/hypercubed-20">18X Internal DVD Drive</a> plus enough DVD media for 600 GB of data or better yet by a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000H9J3WU/hypercubed-20">300 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive</a> for $20 more.

<p>This reminds me of the time I noticed a woman at the service center of a major retail computer store picking up a repaired PC.&nbsp; I noticed her because it was the same PC that I owned in the late 90’s (HP 85 something).&nbsp; Standing in ear shot I could hear that she had extra memory installed in the machine.&nbsp; If I recall correctly that machine needed PC100 memory and must be installed in matching pairs.&nbsp; Let’s say she put in two 256 MB chips.&nbsp; These cost at least $40 each for each 256 MB chip.&nbsp; The service charge for that place is $100 minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this poor woman paid at $180+ to maintain a 10 year old machine.&nbsp; You can buy a new computers for $200 - $300.&nbsp; What a rip-off!&nbsp;

<p><a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/image3.png"><img style="border: 0px none ; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="image" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/image-thumb2.png" align="right" border="0" height="271" width="204" /></a> I came from a pretty poor family.&nbsp; Sometimes we only had enough money to eat, sometimes not even that.&nbsp; However, through education (the great equalizer), I managed to work my way up the economic ladder to a very comfortable middle class career.&nbsp; Unfortunately, because of my background I had developed some pretty nasty speech habits.&nbsp; It is not that poor people are stupid; it's just that the acceptable standard for verbal communication is different.&nbsp; Below are 10 things that I needed to learn in order to effectively communicate in the professional work force.&nbsp; I'm not talking about learning the queens English or preventing dangling participles.&nbsp; I'm talking about very simple things that everyone, whatever economic level you are at currently, can do to improve their self presentation.

  <li><strong>Purge your vocabulary of non-existent words.</strong>&nbsp; Very few of us use the word Gooder, right?&nbsp; That's because gooder is not a word.&nbsp; Neither is <em>ain't</em>, <em>irregarless</em>, and <em>nah</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix your poor pronunciation.</strong>&nbsp; This one is hard for me.&nbsp; The word is nu-clear not Nuke-u-ler.&nbsp; It's <em>across the street</em>, not <em>acrossed the street</em>.&nbsp; And many <a href="http://www.alphadictionary.com/articles/mispronounced_words.html">more</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Eliminate double negatives.</strong>&nbsp; If you "don't got none" then you must have got some.&nbsp; Honestly, ain't nothing gonna' make you look more stupid than a double negative.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to use the correct word.</strong>&nbsp; Learn the difference between Affect and Effect (<a href="http://wsuonline.weber.edu/wrh/words.htm">more</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Eliminate misused phases.</strong>&nbsp; "I could care less" for example.&nbsp; If you could care less, then that implies that you care more than one might expect.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suppose to" is incorrect, it's supposed to be "supposed to".</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid slang.</strong>&nbsp; Know your audience.&nbsp; Limit slang as much as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid verbal tics.</strong>&nbsp; Again, know your audience.&nbsp; Avoid "Um... Dude, can I like maybe possibly get a copy of that" in the workplace.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid Cursing.</strong>&nbsp; We all do it.&nbsp; Reserve it for when it is necessary.&nbsp; Using the F-word every other sentence in a meaningless manner just doesn't fuckin' sound right.</li>
  <li><strong>Don't over do it by eliminating contractions.</strong>&nbsp; Contractions are a normal and acceptable part of the English language.&nbsp; "I'm", "You're", and "can't", are all good.&nbsp; If you walk around saying "I am going to lunch now" you look like you are trying too hard to sound intelligent.&nbsp; Either that or you're a robot (because somehow super-intellgent robots can't learn to use contractions).</li>
  <li><strong>Don't use words that exceed your vocabulary.</strong>&nbsp; If a short word fits what you are trying to say, say it.&nbsp; Don't throw in a long word just because it sounds <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/decorous">decorous</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even the most educated among us will violate these rules very often.&nbsp; The key is three steps: (1-5) eliminate completely errors in your speech, (6-8) know your audience and level of formality required, (9-10) don't over extend yourself.

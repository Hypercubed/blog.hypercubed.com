<p>Last week when <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">Techsmith</a> started giving away old versions of <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/11/26/get-snagit-7-25-from-techsmith-for-free/">SnagIt screen capture software</a> and <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/11/22/techsmith-offers-free-camtasia-studio-download/">Camtasia Studio screencasting software</a> I of course snatched up one of each.&nbsp; They are both great tools even if they are not the latest version.&nbsp; I had been using SnagIt at work and now having it at home is great.&nbsp; I had never used Camtasia before so to give it a spin I threw together a screencast introduction to <a title="Xinha Here! Firefox Extension" href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">Xinha Here</a> (my semi-popular Firefox extension).</p> <p>The Camtasia software worked great.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my production skills are not so great.&nbsp; Even though I spent a good amount of my day on this it still looks a little shoddy.&nbsp; I think I went too fast.&nbsp; Which brings me to my only complaint about this software.&nbsp; It would be nice if you could variably speed up and down the video in sections.&nbsp; Hopefully they added this to their latest version.&nbsp; Next time I will go a little slower and try adding voice.</p> <p>So after the fold is a simple introduction to Xinha Here Firefox extension.</p>

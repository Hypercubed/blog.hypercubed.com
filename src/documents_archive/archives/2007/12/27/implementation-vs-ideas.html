<p>If you take a look at my primary website (<a href="http://www.hypercubed.com">www.hypercubed.com</a>) you will see three applications that I developed.&nbsp; Each project is currently at a sub 1.0 version.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">Xinha Here</a> is version 0.12, <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/coordex/">CoordEx</a> is 0.8, and <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/games/nwn/">NWN duplicator</a> is 0.3.&nbsp; The sub 1.0 version number means that I don't feel the application is "ready for prime time".&nbsp; I feel there is still many bugs and missing features.&nbsp; Now these are the three projects that I felt were at least complete enough for sharing.&nbsp; In addition to these I probably have a dozen or more applications on my HD that were never complete enough for any sort of release.&nbsp; I also developed a few web application over the years that I never discussed publicity.&nbsp; Some of them (in my opinion) are very good and may even be money makers if released.&nbsp; They are just to unpolished or buggy to share even in a beta phase.</p> <p>I've been doing some thinking on why I have released so few projects over the eight years I've been online (hypercubed.net was purchased December 1999) compared to the number of applications that I build.&nbsp; In addition why have none of them reached a quality level necessary for earning some real income.&nbsp; I think it can all be summarized in the following completely made up graph<!--more-->.&nbsp; </p><div id='extendedEntryBreak' name='extendedEntryBreak'></div> <p align="center"><a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/image1.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="288" alt="image" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/image-thumb1.png" width="394" border="0"></a> </p> <p>As you can see three things are conspiring against me.&nbsp; First is the complexity factor.&nbsp; As the feature set grows the time needed to add each feature grows even faster.&nbsp; Each new feature takes longer and longer to implement.&nbsp; Second, I usually work on the interesting part of the project first, everything else is bells, whistles, and polish.&nbsp; Sometimes just implementing the interesting part is enough to release a Version 0.1 (basic usability) but more often then not the interesting part is over well before a publicly shareable release is ready.&nbsp; The third thing conspiring against me is my available time.&nbsp; Developing application and running my website is a hobby.&nbsp; I do have a day job and a very demanding one if you ask me.&nbsp; With such limited time available I can't get much beyond the interesting parts of the project without feeling the pull to other more interesting projects.&nbsp; Sometimes I come back to old projects but often I don't.&nbsp; I seam to always be in the vicious cycle of starting interesting projects, running out of steam, then starting the next.&nbsp; Someday this needs to stop.</p> <p>There are several solution to this dilemma; none of them very easy.&nbsp; I could quit my day job and work on development full time (Hypercubed, Inc. anyone).&nbsp; Isn't it everyone's dream to turn their hobby into their work?&nbsp; But I don't think I would be able to make enough to support my family anytime soon.&nbsp; The second is to get a partner.&nbsp; Unfortunately most people I know are not interested in the geeky stuff I work on.&nbsp; I could lower my standards and release every project regardless of the state.&nbsp; If the project generates interest then that would be a driver for me to add more time.&nbsp; The problem with this is that most people on the web are leaches (myself included) thousands of people may download a piece of software but only a handful will comment on it and their comments are not usually helpfully (<em>where is the anykey?).&nbsp; </em>  Last is to make a the project to open source.&nbsp; I've been considering this for a long time but just not sure how to do that.&nbsp; It seams to me that the same curve may apply to managing the open source project.&nbsp; I say it almost every day at work... <em>I'm not a manager... and I don't want to be</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

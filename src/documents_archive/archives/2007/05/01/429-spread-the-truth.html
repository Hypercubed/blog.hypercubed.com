<p>We all know that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yoOMJxT860">fire does not melt steel</a> (thanks Rosie O'Donnell for that information!).&nbsp; Therefore, by the principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_Razor">Ockham's razor</a>&nbsp;we must conclude that 9/11 was a giant conspiracy masterminded by "the decider" G. W. Bush in order to lead us to war in Iraq.&nbsp; &nbsp;Duh!</p> <p>Well, if <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/fires/steel.html">80,000 gallons of jet fluid can't melt steel</a> then <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/04/29/BAGVOPHQU46.DTL">8,600 gallons of unleaded gasoline</a> definitely can't melt steel.&nbsp; Therefore we must all conclude that 4/29 was a giant conspiracy masterminded by "<a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2006/05/al_gore_another.html">the presenter</a>" A. Gore in order to lead us to buy more hybrids.&nbsp; Obvious!</p> <p><a href="http://www.429truth.com/">Learn the truth at&nbsp;4/29truth.com</a></p>

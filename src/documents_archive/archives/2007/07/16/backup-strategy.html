<p>Hard drives will crash, houses catch on fire, previously unknown volcanoes erupt turning your entire town into a magma flow.&nbsp; No matter what the issue I want to keep my data.&nbsp; Personal writings, e-mails, programming projects, and family photos are very important to me.&nbsp; I am very paranoid about losing data so I have developed what I think is a very robust backup strategy.</p> <p>Before even thinking about backing up my data I had to organize my data.&nbsp; On my PC I have installed&nbsp;two HD&nbsp;(well really three but I'll get into that later) .&nbsp; The first (primary) drive holds the OS, program files,&nbsp;and the temp directories.&nbsp; The second HD stores only data.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've moved the "My Documents", "Desktop", etc to the second drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rational behind this is that the OS and program files are replaceable.&nbsp; I can reinstall them from the source any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;My data on the other had is irreplaceable.&nbsp; This is the stuff I really don't want to lose... ever. With all the data files on the second drive I can focus on backing up that drive alone.&nbsp; Of course having two&nbsp;having two drives may double my chances of a failure but hopeful each drive will see a little less ware an tear than a single drive would see.&nbsp; I don't really know if it works this way but I'll go with it.</p> <p>So now that I have one HD that I need to backup where do I back it up?&nbsp; Well, with several gigs of data backing up to DVD could be a pain and completely impossible on CDs.&nbsp; For a while I was backing up all my data to a large (but slow) third internal drive.&nbsp; This was fine but I wanted something a little more robust and potentiality portable.&nbsp; So I purchased a&nbsp;<a title="Amazon.com: Maxtor 300 GB USB 2.0 OneTouch III Series 16 MB Cache Hard Drive ( T01H300 ): Electronics" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000H9J3WU/hypercubed-20">Maxtor 300 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive</a>.&nbsp; I was tempted to buy <a title="Amazon.com: Maxtor One Touch III Turbo 1 TB RAID External Hard Drive ( C01W010 ): Electronics" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BW32IY/hypercubed-20">Maxtor 1 TB RAID External Hard Drive</a>.&nbsp; The 1TB RAID drive is actually two hard drives that&nbsp;can act like a single&nbsp;500GB drive with redundancy&nbsp;but I got a really good deal on the 320 GB version so I went with that.&nbsp; The Maxtor dive plugs&nbsp;into my USB 2.0 port and is very fast, portable, and somewhat ruggedized.&nbsp; This way I can backup all the computers in my house by moving the HD around.&nbsp; This is much faster than backing up over the LAN.&nbsp; And in case of an emergency I can grab the drive itself.</p> <p>The Maxtor drive comes with a simple backup tool.&nbsp; This software&nbsp;provides for incremental backups (only copies new and changed files) of the directories you specify on your PC.&nbsp; Even though I already had a backup/sycronization tool (more below) I tries out teh Maxtor software.&nbsp; I asked the software to backup my "My Documents" folder and all sub-directories.&nbsp; At first it seams to be working really well.&nbsp; I was surprised at how fast it was scanning and coping my files.&nbsp; Then after a closer look I saw that it was not coping some subfolders in the "My Documents" directory including my projects directory.&nbsp; My projects directory is probably the most vital directory I have and is very large.&nbsp; No wonder the backup was so fast, it was skipping all the&nbsp;large stuff (damn procrastinating software).&nbsp; I don't know why teh software was doing this&nbsp;but I instantly lost all confidence in that software.&nbsp; Backup software needs to work flawlessly.</p> <p>So I fell back to the software I was using before I got the Maxtor drive:&nbsp; <a title="Buy SyncBackSE V4.2.1.0" href="http://store.eSellerate.net/a.asp?c=1_SKU22989555596_AFL4158900366&amp;at=">SyncBackSE</a>.&nbsp; SyncBackSE is the best backup/synchronization software I can find and I have tried quite a few.&nbsp; With this software you have full control (I like control) of the backup/synchronization process.&nbsp; Unlike the Maxtor software you can specify your own backup file structure.&nbsp; You can backup from a network drive or an FTP server.&nbsp; You can even compress the files to password protected zips.&nbsp; You can also tell the software to ignore certain files or directories based on filters.&nbsp; Probably my favorite feature is the confirmation of effects before action is taken.&nbsp; In other words after scanning the directories SyncBackSE can give you a summary of what files you are coping or deleting giving you a chance to cancel or change an individual action.&nbsp;&nbsp;Never&nbsp;again will I accidentally "backup" my backup data over my source data (<a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2007/03/i_am_totally_sc.html">it happens</a>).&nbsp; With SyncBackSE you can perform your backups manually, on a schedule, or from&nbsp;the command line.&nbsp; I have even setup my Maxtor drive to run SyncBackSE when the backup button on the Maxtor is pressed.&nbsp; There really is too many great features in SyncBackSE&nbsp;so you should check it out yourself.&nbsp;  <p>So far I'm protected against a single HD crashes.&nbsp; But what if my data drive and back drive crash at the same time, or my computer and backup drive are stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time I was backing up my data to a few DVD-RWs.&nbsp; But DVD backup is slow, manually intensive, and doesn't protect against fire (or volcano).&nbsp; I need something completely off-site.&nbsp; I had considered using&nbsp;my massive 490 GB&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159058|HYPERCUBED50">DreamHost</a>&nbsp;space as an offsite backup but&nbsp;after the recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2007/06/06/security-breach/">security breach</a> I decided that wasn't a&nbsp;good idea.  <p>Last year I came across <a title="You shouldn't have to think about backup." href="http://www.mozy.com/?kbid=31195">Mozy</a> online storage.&nbsp; I signed up for the&nbsp;2GB of free online storage.&nbsp; Mozy is a dead simple application that works very similar to the most basic backup tools.&nbsp; You select the files you need to backup and while your computer is idle it compresses, encrypts, and transmits your new or changed files to the Mozy servers.&nbsp; Your data can be restored though the Mozy software or accessed online.&nbsp; Not only that but Mozy keeps previous versions of your files for up to 30 days.&nbsp; With only 2 GB of storage you need to be selective about what you backup.&nbsp; For example with only 2 GB I didn't backup&nbsp;any of&nbsp;my family photos.&nbsp; However, recently Mozy changed their pricing to be only $4.95 per month for unlimited data.&nbsp; That really is a price that can't be beat (it actually can't... I've checked). <p>Ok, so now I have all my data on my secondary drive, periodically backed up to my backup drive.&nbsp; I then setup Mozy to backup my backup.&nbsp; Why not backup&nbsp;directly from the&nbsp;data drive?&nbsp; In this setup I know that the backup drive is always the latest.&nbsp; Restoring over the Internet&nbsp;is slow.&nbsp; I only need to restore from Mozy in an extreme emergency (think volcano).&nbsp; Second, since Mozy runs somewhat continuously it can be a waist to backup files that change daily or several times a day.&nbsp; By backing up from the backup drive the schedule I choose for SyncBackSE&nbsp;regulates the backup schedule for Mozy.  <p>How well does&nbsp;this work?&nbsp; I really don't know.&nbsp; Since creating this backup strategy I've not had a HD crash, computer fire, or volcano eruption.&nbsp; If and when it happens I'll let you know how it works... if I have a computer from which to blog.

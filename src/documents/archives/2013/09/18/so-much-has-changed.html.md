While refreshing my blog (or should I say placing it in cold storage) I did a quick run through of all my past posts.  I have to say there is a lot of crap there.  I mean I'm kind of embarrassed of some of the stupid content and general sloppiness.  I'm tempted to trash the whole thing... but... here I am.  At least by exporting all my posts I now have some archive of my blogging years.

When I started blogging in 2005 I was married, living with my wife and son, and working as an aerospace engineer in sunny southern California.  Now I'm divorced, living alone, and working in bioinformatics in typhoon prone Tokyo.  Many of the tools I once blogged about I no longer use and many of the resource I reviewed are now dead.  He is a brief run down for the fun of it:

- Wordpress				- Finally replaced with a static site, [docpad](http://docpad.org/)
- Firefox				- Now using Chrome
- Xinha Here  			- This was my WYSIWYG HTML editor in Firefox (see above)
- ING Savings Account	- The APR when to near zero long ago
- BlogJet				- Markdown!!
- RoboForm				- LastPass
- Haloscan Trackback	- What was that?
- Visual Studio			- No need
- MapPoint				- Google maps
- Active Server Pages	- Killed by PHP, which I wish were dead to me as well.

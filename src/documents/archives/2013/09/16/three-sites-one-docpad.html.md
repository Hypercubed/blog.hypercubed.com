I haven't written a blog post in over two years. So, it is somewhat ironic that my first post after so long is to announce that I now have a new design. "Why design a new site for a dead blog?"  Well, the new site combines three dormant sites into one semi-dormant site.  While combining my vanity url [jharshbarger.com](http://jharshbarger.com) and my project site [hypercubed.com](http://www.hypercubed.com) I also rolled in my blog archives for good measure. I designed this new site using [docpad](http://docpad.org/) static site generator. The source code for the entire site can be found here: [Hypercubed/blog.hypercubed.com](https://github.com/Hypercubed/blog.hypercubed.com). The process of designing a site using DocPad was pleasant enough.  However, the process of extracting the wordpress posts ~~and converting to markdown~~ (Edit: actually I only converted a few to markdown) was not (requiring some sloppy [node-fu](https://gist.github.com/Hypercubed/67fa2c68f2626ff4ecb4)). There is sill some hiccups to be ironed out, and potentially more to come, but I wanted to stop screwing with wordpress and move on to [other (bigger and better) things](http://hypercubed.com/projects/).

I recently purchased an Android phone (Nexus One).  One reasons for my choice was the openness of the platform (<a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/03/09/a-belated-new-year%E2%80%99s-resolution-no-walled-gardens/">no walled gardens</a>).  I've been playing around with the live wallpaper feature and have managed to cobble together a Hypercube Live Wallpaper.  The app itself is not quite ready to share but below is a screen capture.  The code for drawing the hypercube comes from the <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2006/03/20/using-pov-ray-to-display-four-dimensional-objects/">pov-ray code I shared years ago</a> (the same code use to generate all the fine hypercube gifs you see scattered around my site) combined with the <a href=" http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/CubeLiveWallpaper/">Cube Live Wallpaper </a> example in the android SDK.  While a lot of the code was already written this has been my first experience with Java.  Just a few more tweaks and I may submit it to the Android marketplace.

Well, it appears after years of hosting Xinha Here! the editors at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1449?id=1449">addons.mozilla.com</a> have decided my extension has problems.  Many of the issues they point out have to do with the Xinha code base.  I designed the Xinha Here! extension to use the Xinha code unmodified.  Where needed I overrode the Xinha code but left the core files intact.  I expect modifying and maintaining changes to the Xinha code will be tedious and time consuming.  Basically it is something I do not want to do.  Until I figure out a way around this feel free to download the Xinha Here extension from <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">my website</a> and wish me luck.

Wow, Hypercubed blog has gotten so boring!  I have not written a manual blog post in over eight months and only 3 posts total in 2009.  I guess sometimes life just gets in the way.  My personal life has been quite dramatic over the last year and a half.  Since this blog is not intended to be about my personal life I'll leave it at that.  Hopefully with this post I'll get past the writers block that occurs after so many months of silence.

A week or so ago I purchased a bluetooth headset on Amazon. At the time I believe the item text said it was mini-usb compatible. This was great considering my phone is mini-usb so I won't needed to buy another car charger. However, When I received the headset I was surprised to find that while the included wall charger was mini-usb the headset itself was micro-usb. The wall charger and headset, purchased as a package, were not compatible. Someone at Amazon bundled the wrong items. I returned to the Amazon store and saw the following message:
<blockquote><em><strong>Item Under Review</strong></em>
  <br />While this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with the item, the way we were shipping it, or the way it's described here. (Thanks for the tip!)
  <br />We're working to fix the problem as quickly as possible.
  <br />
</blockquote>
<p align="left">So, they had discovered the problem and were working on it.&nbsp; I contacted customer support and they advised me to return the item at their expense.&nbsp; After doing a little more research I discovered that mini-usb to micro-usb adapters are fairly cheap on Amazon.&nbsp; I contacted Amazon support once again and asked if I can receive $5 credit to purchase an adapter.&nbsp; I had little hope that they would oblige.&nbsp; Much to my surprise within a few hours I received a message that the are refunding my credit card $5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Way to go Amazon...&nbsp; this is why I love you... that and free shipping on items over $25.

<p>&nbsp;By the way... this is a great headset.

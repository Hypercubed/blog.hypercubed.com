I travel to Japan a few times a year.  I usually bring along a point and shoot camera to snap a few pictures of friends and family.   Inspired by <a href="http://www.tokyoform.com/">TokyoForm</a> and <a href="http://shoottokyo.com/">Shoot Tokyo</a> I decided it was time to get a real camera and attempt to capture some of the great stuff I see.  I returned with 16 GBs of photos.  Here are a few shots that I enjoyed.  You can find the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hypercubed/sets/72157626775529064/">full photostream</a> over on flickr.

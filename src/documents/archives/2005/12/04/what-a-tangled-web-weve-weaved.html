<p>
So I was reading an interesting article over at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">boingboing</a> lastnight and I wanted to see what other bloggers have said on the topic so I clicked on the &quot;blogs' comments&quot;  link and I was taken to <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/">Technorati search</a>.  On the left had side of the Technorati site I noticed an advertisement enticing me to make money from blogging (You've got to love directed advertising). So I clicked the ad and was brought to <a href="http://performancing.com/">performancing.com</a> a &quot;group weblog written by professional bloggers, for professional bloggers.&quot;  So I started reading a few of the entries.  Mainly clicking on the titles that seamed interesting to me.  Finally I clicked on an article titled &quot;<a href="http://performancing.com/node/272">Firefox Extensions For Bloggers</a>&quot;.  I'm a blogger and I like Firefox so that seamed like a good article.  In this article <a href="http://performancing.com/user/6">Chris Garrett</a> discusses his top five picks for most useful extensions for bloggers.  I was shocked to see #3 was my very own <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">Xinha Here</a>.  That was quite a shock.&nbsp;  Xinha Here is less then a month old and is still having <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/megabbs/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=106&amp;posts=1">some issues</a>.  Glad to know that it is being found useful.</p><p>So I did a Google search for &quot;Xinha Here&quot; to get an idea of it's spread.&nbsp; A couple of blogs that mention Xinha Here (<a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4673">Gadgetopia.com</a> , <a href="http://jei.afraid.org/wordpress/index.php/2005/11/24/wordpress-spelling-checker-and-visual-wysiwyg-editor/">The WeBlog of John</a>, and <a href="http://baptiste.us/2005/11/10/xinha-for-firefox/">The Baptists Family blog</a>).&nbsp; Unfortunately I'm seeing many comments everywhere (on my blog, at <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org">addons.mozilla.org,</a> and even <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4673">Gadgetopia.com</a>) about the lack of Firefox 1.5 support.&nbsp; The truth is that Firefox 1.5 support has been around for a few weeks now.&nbsp; addons.mozilla.org is very slow in updating the extension entries and each submission needs to be reviewed.&nbsp; If you want the latest version of any extension you should always check the authors website directly.&nbsp; You can always get the latest version of Xinha Here from <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">my website</a>.</p><p>I'm starting to think that if Xinha Here is going to be a popular project I should have thought of a better name.&nbsp; Xinha Everywhere or Xinha Anywhere might have been more appropriate?<br /></p>

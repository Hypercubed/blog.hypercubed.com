WordPress 2.0 was release today and I deceide to upgarde.  Usually I wait a few days to see if there are any major issues but feeling confident I went for it.  I screwed up!

The installation appeared to go fine.  I upgraded the DB and that appeared fine.  Of course the website was still showing errors at this point because all my plugins were deactivated.  No problem just reactivate the plugins.  I expected a few not to work.  I checked what I use against the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/2.0_Plugin_Compatibility">compatibility list</a> and was aware of where the problems will be.  But my issue is more serious then that.  I cannot activate ANY plugin.  That's right... NONE of them work.  It's not like that are incompatable or anything.  I click the activate link and the browser reports "Plugin Activated"... but it is flat out lying. No matter what I do no plugins are not activated.  GRRRR.... so I've modified a few things to ensure that most of the site works without plugins but a few things are still broken.  Somebody help me I can't live without my plugins!

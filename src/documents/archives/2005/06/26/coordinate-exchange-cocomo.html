<div style="clear: both;"></div><p>So as a follow-up to my <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/06/show-me-your-underpants-code.html">last post</a> regarding <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/coordex/">Coordinate Exchange</a> I did some digging and discovered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO">COCOMO model </a>for software cost estimations. In it's basic form COCOMO can estimate the total effort of a project from the SLOC (source lines of code). So after a little more searching I found <a href="http://www.vb-helper.com/howto_count_project_lines.html">this program</a> by <a href="mailto:RodStephens_at_vb-helper.com">Rod Stephens at vb-helper.com</a> to count the number of lines in Coordinate Exchange. So using Rod's program and the COCOMO model I calculate the following for my Coordinate Exchange project:</p>

*** Basic COCOMO model ***
**************************
Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC): 8,102
Development Effort Est., Person-Yrs (Person-Months): 1.80 (21.59)
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months): 0.67 (8.03)
Total Estimated Cost to Develop: $310,882</code></pre>
<br />The development effort seams high. I've been working on CoordEx at most three years now so I don't know how I can spend almost two man-years on it. In any event that is an estimated 300,000 price tag for CoordEx. So based on the amount of money I've received for CoordEx development that is a P/E (price to earnings) ratio of 1800. In other words I've earned less then 0.06% of what CoordEx is worth. Do I believe this is the actual value of CoordEx? Not really... just an interesting evaluation. <p>&nbsp;</p><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

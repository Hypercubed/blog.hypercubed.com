<div style="clear:both;"></div><div><font face="Arial" size="2"><div><font face="Arial" size="2"><p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/03/welcome-to-hypercubed-blog.html">briefly mentioned</a> my <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/coordex/">Coordinate Exchange application</a> before.&nbsp; This application started as a simple plug-in for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/MapPoint/default.mspx">MS MapPoint</a>&nbsp;to enter and extract pushpin data (latitude and longitude data) but quickly grew into something more.&nbsp; While still restricted to working within MapPoint it has many features hat work independently of MapPoint.&nbsp; This application can read and write GPS data to and from several different file formats and communicate directly with some GPS units.&nbsp; While writing it I attempted to make it easy to add new file formats and GPS units as time goes on.&nbsp; Matter of fact every once in a while I receive an e-mail asking if I can support a new file format and it generally takes me less then a hour to add it (as long as it is text based).&nbsp; At the core of CoordEx is a simple macro language that translate the data at ease.&nbsp; It is easy for me to read data in one format and out put in another and even scale the value along the way in case of a needed unit conversion (i.e. meters to feet).&nbsp; This macro language is something that nobody has ever seen.&nbsp; It is embedded inside my code and not available to the users but every time I need to add something to CoordEx I appreciate the work I did early on to make this system flexible.</p><p>Well, now to the point of my post.&nbsp; I was recently approached by a small GPS unit manufacture (I wont mention the name as I don&rsquo;t have their permission).&nbsp; I was asked if I&rsquo;d be interested in contributing to an application they were developing that can read data form their GPS unit and output several different file formats for use in other mapping applications.&nbsp; At first I was very interested in this.&nbsp; I spent several days discussing the list of required features and how deliverables will be made and so on.&nbsp; As time when on I began to think more about this.&nbsp; What they wanted was that because my CoordEx application was already constructed it would be quick and simple to reuse some of my code for their applications.</p><p>Well, as I thought about it more I realized that that portion of my code needed to make their application work was the core of CoordEx and includes the macro-language that I&rsquo;ve come to love an appreciate so much over the years.&nbsp; How much was that worth to me.&nbsp; Sure there was no requirement that I stop development on CoordEx and the time it would have taken me to embed the CoordEx core inside there application would be minimal but is it worth it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d earn a few hundred dollars easily and they would sell there applications and make some more for themselves.&nbsp; They are not going to get rich off my code and it is easily re-creatable.&nbsp; It is not like I&rsquo;m sitting on the foundations of MS-DOS (<a href="http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa033099.htm">QDOS</a>)&nbsp;and they are going to go off and make millions.&nbsp; No, they will probably hire a few freelance programmers to knock out a simple application that fits their needs and someone will make several hundred.</p><p>But I guess it is not the money.&nbsp; It is the felling that by handing over the core of this application that I&rsquo;ve spent so long developing I&rsquo;m losing something of much more sentimental value then what it is worth in real value.&nbsp; Sure, for a large sum or some type of royalty rights I could be convinced to hand over a copy and reveal my <s>underpants</s> code but I don&rsquo;t think anyone is willing to pay for the sentimental value of code.</p><p>On a side note; now that I have figured out the <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/04/visual-studio-cannot-debug-mappoint.html">debugging issue in VS 2003</a>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been working (although rather slowly) on converting CoordEx to .NET.&nbsp; After the conversion CoordEx will run independently of MapPoint and will be a convenient GPS data conversion tool for a much wide audience.</p></font></div></font></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

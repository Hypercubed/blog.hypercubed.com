Every once in a while I discover a &quot;new&quot; feature in a software
application that has been there forever staring me in the face. Today I
had such a discover that I'd like to share. First the background. Often
when I'm at a website reading a news article for example I'll want to
search for more information on something. Perhaps a name or a company
for example. What I did back in my IE days was to copy the text, open a
new window, navigate to goggle or a9, paste the text into the text box
and hit search. In Firefox this process got simpler. I can copy the
text and past it into Firefox's search box. This was defiantly an
improvement. Well today I discovered a new way to speed up this task.
Highlight the text, right-click, then select Search web for &quot;XXX&quot;. XXX
will be the text you highlighted. Firefox will search for that term on
your default browser and your done. As easy as that. Saves me a lot of
time so I thought I would share because if it has slipped under my nose
for this long I'm sure there are others that have missed it.

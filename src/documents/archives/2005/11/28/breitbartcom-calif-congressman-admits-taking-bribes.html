How could this be such a big surprise. Doesn't anyone wonder how a
congressman can afford a mansion and a yacht. Are these guys paid that
well? I guess that's what happens when you get to set your own
salaries.&nbsp; But that brings up a bigger issue.&nbsp; Why are the
highest paying jobs in our country, maybe the world, professional liers?&nbsp;
Think about it:
<ul>
  <li>Politician: Was there every a politician elected for being honest? - &quot;Trust me, that other politician is a lier.&quot;</li>
  <li>Lawyers: They are paid to spin the truth. - &quot;If it doesn't fit, you must equit&quot;</li>
  <li>Actors: They are paid to convince us they are somebody they are not.</li></ul>
Why are professional liers making so much and teachers and nurses make
so little. Well, in all honestly I know the answer. Simple supply
and demand. Teachers and nurses are easy to find, train, and
retain. In comparison it takes many years to become a good
lier and not everyone can do it. That places qualified individuals in
demand. I hope that someday we can begin to place more value honesty.

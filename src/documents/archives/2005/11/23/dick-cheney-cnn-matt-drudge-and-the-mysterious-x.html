From <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/flash3cnc.htm">Drudge</a>:<br />
<blockquote>CNN was airing Vice President Dick Cheney's speech live
from the American Enterprise Institute in Washington -- when a large
black 'X' repeatedly flashed over the vice president's face!
<br />
<br />The 'X' over Cheney's face appeared each time less than a second, creating an odd subliminal effect.
<br />
<br />As this DRUDGE REPORT screen capture reveals, while one 'X' flashed
over Cheney's face CNN ran a headline at the bottom of its screen:
&quot;CHENEY: I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS WRONG TO CRITICIZE.&quot;
<br />
<br />One top White House source expressed concern about what was aired
over CNN. &quot;Is someone in Atlanta trying to tell us something?&quot;</blockquote>

A CNN official gave this response to the matter via <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/drudge_delighted_by_cnn_glitch_28496.asp">TVNewser</a>:
<br />
<blockquote>&quot;Upon seeing this unfortunate but very brief graphic,
CNN senior management immediately investigated. We concluded this was a
technological malfunction not an issue of operator error. <div style="border: medium solid Yellow;">Our NSM-3000 equipment experienced a momentary glitch.&nbsp; <u>N</u>ervous <u>S</u>ystem <u>M</u>anipulation <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/050331behaviormodificationtv">is not intended to operate through the insertion of single-frame images but rather by modulation of the signal.</a></div>We obviously regret that it happened and are working on the equipment to ensure it is not repeated.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>I'm very glad they clarified that.</p>

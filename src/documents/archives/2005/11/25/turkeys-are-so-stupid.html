So today (yesterday) is (was) Thanksgiving. Like many Americans I ate
turkey and failed to give any thought to what I'm thankfull for. While
eating that turkey I once again heard the old tale &quot;I heard that turkeys are so stupid
they will look up at falling rain until they drown&quot;. Of course I had
heard that before and I thought: &quot;Interesting, wonder if that is true&quot;.
That is the deeply rooted reaction I normally have to these types of
&quot;facts&quot;. Old habits are hard to break but that is the way people worked
back in the B.G. years (before Goggle). Tall tales would be told and
travel person to person without anybody being able to collect facts on
the story. Each person wouldn't know if the facts are true but not
having an easy way to research it they would pass on the information
themselves shrugging responsibility by prefacing their telling
with&nbsp; &quot;I heard...&quot;.</p><p>Well,
like I said that was the bad B.G. days.&nbsp; I'm trying to rid myself
of blind acceptance of &quot;facts&quot; and research things like this.&nbsp; So
I once again consulted the great Google and discovered that in this case the
tale is..... indeterminate.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/turkey.htm">snopes.com</a>
this &quot;fact&quot; is false because turkeys do not have binocular vision (eyes
in front) they cannot look up at rain.&nbsp; They would need to look
sideways.&nbsp; Ok, so that makes sense but does that mean that they
never drown in rain?&nbsp; Tom Savage, a poultry scientist in the
Oregon State University Animal Sciences Department, <a href="http://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/story.php?S_No=92&amp;storyType=news">says</a>
that turkeys do appear to be looking at the sky but the behavior is a
genetically-caused nervous disorder called tetanic torticollar
spasms.&nbsp; However, <a href="http://www.teachkind.org/feat/turkey/elem_trivia.html">PETA</a>
says that turkeys point their beaks skyward to streamline their bodies
and therefore minimize exposure to rain.&nbsp; Ok, so turkeys may in
fact appear point their beaks skyward but it is not because they are stupid
it's either a nervous disorder or they are trying to keep them
selves dry.&nbsp; But do they drown?&nbsp; Tom Savage, our OSU poultry
expert, <a href="http://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/story.php?S_No=92&amp;storyType=news">says</a> he has never heard of this actually happening.&nbsp; The PETA website says it doesn't happen.&nbsp; Cecil Adams at <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_010">straightdope.com</a>
says that young turkeys do die in rain but not from looking up.&nbsp;
Instead they die from exposure because the young turkeys down is
vulnerable to the effects of weather.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast to all this
according to <a href="http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/turkey/history.html">University of Illinois</a>
at least some turkey experts speculate that turkeys are curiously
looking at raindrops falling from the sky have been known to actually
drown in this position because their tiny nostrils make the prefect
receptacle for the falling rain.&nbsp; However, according to <a href="http://www.hokaturkeys.com/faqs.htm">Howard Kaufman Turkey Farms</a> and <a href="http://shepherdshillfarm.home.mindspring.com/id7.html">Shepherds Hill farm and Gardens</a> they have raised 
turkeys outside and have never lost one to drowning in the rain.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://home.aristotle.net/Thanksgiving/turkey_facts.asp">Aristotle's turkey facts</a> turkeys can drown if they look up when it is raining.&nbsp; Karen Davis, PhD <a href="http://www.gentlethanksgiving.org/action/FSTurkeys.pdf">disagrees</a>.</p><p>Ok, so we have to go to a score card:</p>

<p>So 7 to 2 says that it's false. In all fairness Tom Savage, Howard
Kaufman Turkey Farms, and Shepherds Hill farm and Gardens all say that
the have simply never seen it happen but even without them it is still leaning
towards a false. </p><p>So Google didn't provide a strait answer on this
one but I'm thankfully for the ability to do the research.&nbsp; I'm
also thankfully that in a few thanksgivings from now when my son asks me &quot;Do turkeys
really drown in the rain.&quot; I can give him an informed answer rather then the
typical &quot;I heard...&quot;.&nbsp; And the one thing I'm most thankful for
this Thanksgiving is, of course, my son.<br />

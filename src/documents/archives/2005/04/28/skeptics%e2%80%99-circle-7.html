So I'm very new to blogging... both writing a blog and reading them. Most of the blogs I've seen don't have anything of interest to me. However, lately I've enjoyed reading several blogs run by various skeptics around the world. If you want a launching pad to these skeptical posts you're in luck. <a href="http://stnate.blogspot.com/">Saint Nate</a> has organized the <a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/">The Skeptics' Circle</a> a biweekly round-robin post that summarizes various posts from around the skeptical blogger community.<br /><br /><a href="http://jgrr.blogspot.com/2005/04/skeptics-circle-7.html">Skeptics' Circle #7</a> is hosted by Josh at <a href="http://jgrr.blogspot.com/">Thoughts from Kansas</a>. Enjoy!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

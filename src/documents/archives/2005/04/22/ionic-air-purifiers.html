<div style="clear:both;"></div>The first time I saw a commercial regarding those ion or ozone air purifiers I knew it was a scam. My theory was that a high efficiency filter doesn't mean anything if the air flow is low. The ORECK XL for example may remove 95% of all particles but if the air exchange rate per hour is very low then most of the air in a room is untouched. Well it turns out that it is even worse then I thought. When the manufactures claim their air purifiers clean 95% of airborne contaminants they provide no particle size range. As a matter of fact these purifiers remove mostly large particles while standard HEPA filters meet a minimum efficiency of 99.97% at 0.3 microns. Turns out the majority of harmful particles are 3 microns or less in size as small particles travel deeper into the lungs, causing more damage while larger particles get trapped in your nose a throat. In addition these ion purifiers can release harmful ozone into your home. Consumer Reports <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=641511">criticizes</a> ionic air purifier. I guess the moral is that scientific claims can be used to mislead... do your research.<br /><br />References:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/ionic_breeze.html">Skeptico: Ionic Breeze</a> </li><li><a href="http://www.aircleaners.com/sharperimage.phtml">The Real Truth About The Ionic Breeze Air Purifiers By Sharper Image</a> </li><li><a href="http://www.aircleaners.com/oreck.phtml">The Real Truth About The ORECK XL Air Purifier</a> </li><li><a href="http://www.pureairsystems.com/university_103.cfm">Air Filtration Fundamentals</a> </li><li><a href="http://www.lakeair.com/particle.html">Common Particles and Their Sizes in Microns</a> </li><li><a href="http://www.surroundair.com/ionic2.htm">Ionic Breeze compared to Surround Air Ionic Air Purifier</a></li></ul><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

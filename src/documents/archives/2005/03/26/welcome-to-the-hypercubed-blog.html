<div style="clear:both;"></div>What is Hypercubed Blog... well it is my local corner of the blog world. I am an physicist by training, engineer by trade, programmer by night. I develop websites and program applications in my spare time. My most popular program is <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/coordex/">Coordinate Exchange</a> a plug-in for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/MapPoint/default.mspx">MS MapPoint</a> that facilitates the exchange of coordinate information in and out of MapPoint. I run several websites including <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/">http://www.hypercubed.com/</a> and I am a (semi-)active developer of <a href="http://www.pd9soft.com/megabbs-support/index.asp">MegaBBS</a>. I was at one time semi-famous for coming up with a method for creating custom tile-sets in NWN. <a href="http://www.bioware.com/bioware_info/press_releases/nwn100nights5/">For that I received a cool award from BioWare</a>. But that should be almost it about me. I have tried running a blog before and I realized I don't like talking about myself. So I will be doing very little of that.<br /><br />So what will I be talking about? Well, I think I'm going to post things that interest me. I am interested in programming, computers, and science. I may occasionally spout off a rant or two about a political issues but I think I really want to focus on creating a online log of what I think is interesting. I spend at least some time almost everyday scouring the web for cool stuff. My favorite sites are <a href="http://slashdot.org/index.pl">Slashdot</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a>. I will be linking to interesting stuff when I find it and posting any interesting things I do or discover.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

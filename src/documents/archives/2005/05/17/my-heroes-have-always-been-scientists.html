<div style="clear:both;"></div>A little poem I wrote (with a little help from <a href="http://www.go2lyrics.com/W/Willie+Nelson/216341.html">Willie Nelson</a>)<br /><br /><div align="center">I grew up dreaming of being a scientist,<br />and loving the scientist ways.<br />Pursuing the works of my well published heroes,<br />I burned up my childhood days.<br />I learned the rule of modern-day science,<br />don't hold on to a paradigm too long.<br />Just take what you need from the shoulders of giants,<br />and pen the words of a new science law.<br /><br />My heroes have always been scientists,<br />and they still are, it seems.<br />Always in search of, but one step in back of,<br />myself and my paradigm-shifting dreams.<br /><br />Scientists are special with their own brand of misery,<br />from being alone too long.<br />You could die from the cold in the arms of a theory,<br />knowing well that your best days are gone.<br />Picking up pens instead of a football,<br />I let the strength of my youth fade away.<br />Old worn-out pencils, and old worn-out minds,<br />with no more ideas and no new discoveries today.<br /><br />My heroes have always been scientists,<br />and they still are, it seems.<br />Always in search of, but one step in back of,<br />myself and my paradigm-shifting dreams.<br /><br />Always in search of, but one step in back of,<br />myself and my paradigm-shifting dreams.</div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

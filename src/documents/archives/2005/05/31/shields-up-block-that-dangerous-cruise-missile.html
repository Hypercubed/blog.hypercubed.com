<div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1632032,00.html">This</a> is an interesting article. Apparently Tom Cruise is offering unsolicited medical (or should I say anti-medical) advice to recent postpartum sufferer Brook Shields. Cruise feels that post-partum depression should be treated with Vitamins. I do think that some people are being over medicated but who is Tom Cruise to be offering medical advise to others. I applaud Shields for calling him out on it. In her words:<br /><br /><blockquote>Tom should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.</blockquote><br />If you read the article you will realize that Shields' depression was extremely severe and taking anti-depressants could likely have saved her life and the life of her daughter. To the other extreme I think people are often over medicating their children. I hear all the time about young children that are taking drugs to control their hyperactivity. Sometimes it may been needed but it seams to me these people have normal active children and they are too lazy, busy, or tired to keep up with them. Children have a lot of energy and just because you can't keep up doesn't mean that you need to dope the hell out of them to make them as slow as you. Also, maybe you should stop pumping them full caffeinated soda all day and then you wont need to give them downers before bed.<br /><br />On the subject of Scientology I have to admit most scientologist I meet (or see on TV) are pretty together people. Maybe the proof is in the pudding but I can't understand how can anyone believe that metal illness is the result of alien ghosts infecting the mind. Or believe in any religion whose founder (science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard) is often quoted as saying "The way to make a million dollars is to start a religion" (this is <a href="http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/scientology/start.a.religion.html">controversial</a>).

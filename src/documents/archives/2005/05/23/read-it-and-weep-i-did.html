<div style="clear:both;"></div>At my work there is a constant (friendly) clash between the physicists and the engineers. Well, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2005/05/15/national/class/index.html">this article</a> at NYTimes.com sets everything straight. According to the article the top 10 classiest occupations are:<br /><br />1. Physicians and Surgeons<br />2. Lawyers<br />3. Database Administrators<br />4. Computer System Administrators<br />5. Astronomers and Physicists<br />6. Chemical Engineers<br />7. Chemists and Materials Scientists<br />8. Network and Data Communications Analysts<br />9. Computer Support Specialists<br />10. Dentists<br /><br />Only one engineer among the bunch (Chemical Engineers at #6) but still below "Astronomers and Physicists" at #5. It takes some work but you can find the other engineers further down:<br /><br />12. Aerospace Engineers<br />20. Engineers, Other<br />22. Civil Engineers<br />43. Mechanical Engineers<br />44. Electrical and Electronic Engineers<br /><br />How sad for all the Electrical Engineers. They are even below "Engineers, Other" at #20. So I guess even if someone argues that I am not a Physicists because my official title is "Engineer/Scientist" I'd still be at #20 safely above "Electrical Engineers". I'm glad that is finally settled.<br /><br />All joking aside I find it interesting that I can rank high in all categories (Occupation, Education, and Income) but at the bottom for Wealth. I guess that is the cost (literally) of living in California.<br /><br />[via: <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/physics_envy/">pharyngula</a>]<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>Goodbye <s>England's</s> Kevin Rose. Last night, with all my excitement over <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/05/mediaman.html">MediaMan and CueCat</a> I almost forgot the biggest news of the evening. <a href="http://www.kevinrose.com">Kevin Rose</a> of <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/index.html">G4's Attack of the Show</a> is leaving the show. I'm sad to see home go. He was the straight man of the group and will defiantly be missed. But the good news is that he is moving on to new (and hopefully better) things. Kevin and others are starting a download only tech show at <a href="http://www.systm.org/">systm.org</a>. Seams to be a very good quality show that might be able to compete with the broadcast shows. I'm not quite sure how they plan to make money but I hope it works out.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

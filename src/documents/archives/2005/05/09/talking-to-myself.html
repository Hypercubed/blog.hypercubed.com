<div style="clear: both;"></div><p>Ok, so now that mention of my <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/04/visual-studio-cannot-debug-mappoint.html">MapPoint post</a> has fallen off the list at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mappoint/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/mappoint/</a> my web traffic has returned to normal (10-15 visits per day) and my dreams of <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/05/web-traffic-and-population-growth.html">worldwide redership</a> have been shattered I can sit back and reflect on the whole blogging experience. Do I mind that my traffic is so low and I am basically writing to myself? No, not really. Sure it would be nice to get a few comments now and then to know if people are interested in what I have to say but it isn't necessary. This blog gives me a way to record the interesting things I find or think about everyday. As my mind wanders so does my blog. From <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/03/antimatter-feynman-diagrams-and.html">special relitivty</a> to <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/05/roboform-is-like-doorknob.html">doorknobs</a>, from <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/04/hypercubed.html">hypercubes</a> to <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/03/memories-of-zelda.html">Zelda</a>. These are just a fraction of the random things that I think about daily.<br /><br />I think that is just the way I am. My mind picks up on things an kicks it around all day long analyzing the topic from every angle my mind is capable of comprehending (often leading to insomnia). I actually had someone tell me that the stuff I talk about during lunch is too weird for them. If my lunch topics are so strange that some people don't want to eat lunch with me then I must be saying something interesting... right? Ok, maybe not. Either way this blog serves several purposes for me: </p><ol><li>it is a great way to record my random thoughts,</li><li>it is a terrific forum to post my discoveries, and</li><li>it is good writing practice. </li></ol><p>Yes, like everyone else and their half-sister-in-law I would like to be a writer. I no longer have fantasies of becoming the next <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asimov">Asimov</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven">Nevin</a> but I sure would like to write one science fiction novel before I go. Tips number one, two, and three for becoming a writer are practice, practice, and practice. Maybe with a little work I can learn to avoid run-on sentences (there are a couple in this post), fix my atrocious grammar, and perhaps through some miracle improve my vocabulary. Is that expecting to much from a blog? Probably, but at least I'm doing something.<br /><br />So what is in the future for the Hypercubed blog? I'm not sure. I'm defiantly not going to promise a new post everyday. Blogging takes work and while I'm blogging I'm neglecting my other projects. I hope that in the future I can balance my blogging and my programming and, hopefully, you will see me post about some of my programming projects here.</p><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

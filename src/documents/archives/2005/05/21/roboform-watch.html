<div style="clear:both;"></div>While doing some <a href="http://www.microcontentnews.com/resources/glossary/egosurfing.htm">ego surfing</a> on <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> I noticed an entry on a <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/RoboForm/20050510">japanese blog</a> translating <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/05/roboform-is-like-doorknob.html">a post I made</a> regarding <a href="http://www.roboform.com/?affid=cubed">RoboForm</a>. I've tried translating the site using <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">babelfish</a> but not getting very good results (did you know <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/babelfish.shtml">Babel Fish</a> is from <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/05/hitchhikers-guide-to-galaxy.html">Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</a>?). It appears that the author is some sort of <a href="http://www.roboform.com/?affid=cubed">RoboForm</a> fan-boy. It is interesting to see such a minor post on my insignificant little blog can seam important enough to be translated to Japanese. I'll have to get someone that knows Japanese to read it to see it was translated by hand or using <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">the fish</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>The <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/the_eighth_skeptics_circle_must_be_malebolge/">eighth edition</a> of the skeptics' circle is now posted over at <a href="http://pharyngula.org/">Pharyngula</a> and the Hypercubed blog makes it's first appearance with <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/05/glass-solid-or-liquid.html">Glass - Solid or Liquid?</a>. Please hold your applause until all the blogs have <s>performed</s> been read.<br /><br />Also, in case you don't get it (I needed to Google it) Malebolge is the eighth level of hell. Seams very appropriate.<br /><br /><blockquote>Many and varied sinners suffer eternally in the multi-leveled Malebolge, an ampitheatre-shapped pit of despair Wholly of stone and of an iron colour: Those guilty of fraudulence and malice; the seducers and pimps, who are whipped by horned demons; the hypocrites, who struggle to walk in lead-lined cloaks; the barraters, who are ducked in boiling pitch by demons known as the Malebranche. The simonists, wedged into stone holes, and whose feet are licked by flames, kick and writhe desperately. The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves. Some wallow in human excrement. Serpents writhe and wrap around men, sometimes fusing into each other. Bodies are torn apart. When you arrive, you will want to put your hands over your ears because of the lamentations of the sinners here, who are afflicted with scabs like leprosy, and lay sick on the ground, furiously scratching their skin off with their nails. Indeed, justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.</blockquote><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>The <a href="http://utiannex.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-saloon-sc-12.html">twelfth skeptic's circle</a> due out on July 7 at <a href="http://www.brentrasmussen.com/">Unscrewing the Inscrutable</a> has shown up early but in the <a href="http://utiannex.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-saloon-sc-12.html">wrong place</a>. I attempted to attend the <a href="http://utiannex.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-saloon-sc-12.html">Skeptic's Circle Saloon</a> but had difficulty finding it because of the confusion in time and location. Originally intended to be held at <a href="http://www.brentrasmussen.com/">Unscrewing the Inscrutable</a> the meeting was instead held a day early at the <a href="http://utiannex.blogspot.com/">UTI Annex</a>. If you read way down at the bottom you will see that I showed up real late, got a little too drunk, and began whining <a href="http://hypercubed.blogspot.com/2005/06/10-lies-my-mother-told-me.html" target="_blank">about the lies my mother told me.</a><br /><br />Completely awesome <a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/">skeptic's circle</a> and yes I was late.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

  I've been hearing about <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> (pronounced juiced)&nbsp;for a while now.&nbsp; In case you haven't heard Joost is a free (and legal) peer-2-peer (p2p) software for distributing TV over the Internet.&nbsp; With Joost you can watch shows from MTV, Comedy Central, National Geographic, and more&nbsp;right on your computer.
  <p>Joost is currently in open beta but by invitation only.&nbsp; That means the only way to try Joost is to have a friend invite you.&nbsp; Unfortunately for me most of my friends <a href="http://www.dontdelete.com/">still search for &quot;Google&quot; in AOL search</a>&nbsp;so I've been left out.&nbsp; Well, on May 1 Joost announced 999 invites per user.&nbsp; What that means is Joost users can stop being greedy with the invites are start handing them out to random strangers.&nbsp; Hey, that's me!&nbsp; I'm a random stranger!</p>
  <p>Thanks to Josh over at <a href="http://ubuntuos.com/">UbuntuOS</a> I can finally try Joost.&nbsp; Thank you very much Josh.</p>
  <p>Would you like to try Joost?&nbsp; Well now that I have&nbsp;a few&nbsp;invites of my own I can give them out to all my friends... oh wait, that's right, my friends are too busy helping <em></em><a href="http://www.crimes-of-persuasion.com/Crimes/Business/nigerian.htm">Howgul Abul Arhu get forty seven million dollars out of Nigeria</a>.&nbsp; I guess I too will have to invite random strangers.&nbsp; If you would like an invite please leave a comment below.&nbsp; Make sure you include a valid e-mail address in &quot;Mail (will not be published)&quot;.&nbsp; You do not, and should not, leave your e-mail address in the comment if you want to avoid spam.&nbsp; I promise to send an invite to at least the first 25 comments (do I even have 25 readers?).&nbsp; After that it depends on how bored I am and how my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome">carpal tunnel</a> is felling.</p>

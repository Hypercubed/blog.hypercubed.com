<p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="192" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/windowslivewriterdeltaco-107c5com-deltaco3.jpg" width="250" align="right" border="0"> The other day I wrote about my <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2007/01/06/mcdonalds/">McDonald's customer service experience</a>.&nbsp; The blog entry was more of an observation then a complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like McDonalds and the employees at the McDonald's near my house are friendly and pleasant.&nbsp; When I <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2006/11/15/frys-quality-service/">wrote about Fry's</a>, on the other hand, it was pure hatred.</p> <p>Another place that I vehemently hate is my&nbsp;local Del Taco.&nbsp; The Del Taco near my house has the worst customer service of any fast food establishment I've ever been to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is the place generally filthy, the customer service is worse than... I don't know.... a vending machine.&nbsp; I'd visit this Del Taco more often if the cashier was a <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/fast-food-selfservice-kiosks-coming-silicon-lifeforms-taking-over-world-219339.php">vending machine</a>.</p> <p>Sometimes I go to this Del Taco, dispute my previous experiences, because of it's location.&nbsp; Sometimes it is just too damn convenient.&nbsp; Usually the cashier is simply not interested in you, your order, or, it appears, even life itself.&nbsp; The typical Del taco greeting here is a silent one.&nbsp; It is that inverted nod that can mean either "What Up Hommie!" or "What you lookin' at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chicano_Cal%C3%B3_words_and_expressions">GÃ¼ero</a>" depending on the person delivering it and with the these cashiers it usually seams more like the later.</p> <p>Anyway, this last weekend the experience was different, and not for the better.&nbsp; I tried to make a quick stop at the Del Taco on my way&nbsp;taking my son to see <a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/happyfeet/">Happy Feet</a>&nbsp;at the cheap theater.&nbsp; Before I could even order I had to wait for the cashier to finish counting the change in the register, yes, all... the... change... in... the.. register.&nbsp; When that was done, she removed the register drawer and walked away.&nbsp; I guess she was done with her shift, nice!&nbsp; As I stood there for googly eyed wondering what I can do now, the manager instructed the floor sweeper to take my order.&nbsp; The floor sweeper responded with "I'm sweepin'".&nbsp; After a short conversation the floor sweeper was&nbsp;somehow persuaded to take my order.&nbsp; </p> <p>I was considering getting a kids meal but I had no idea what were the contents of a Del Taco kids meal and I had plenty of time while the last cashier was counting change to realize that the Kids meal was, apparently, not on the menu behind the counter.&nbsp; The conversation went like this (notice no greeting).</p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> Um, what is in a Kids meal?<br><strong>Cashier:</strong> Which one?<br><strong>Me:</strong> I don't know, what type is there.<br><strong>Cashier:</strong> Hamburger or Taco.</p> <p><em>I found out later that they also have a quasadilla but she didn't tell me that.&nbsp; She also didn't tell me the sides which is what I really wanted to know but I decided to move on.</em></p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> How much?<br><strong>Cashier:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Me:</strong> I don't see a Kids meal on the menu... how much is it?<br><strong>Cashier:</strong> It's on the menu.</p> <p><em>She is not turning around or anything.</em></p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> I don't see it.<br><strong>Cashier:</strong> It's there.</p> <p><em>Still&nbsp;not turning around.</em></p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> Can you show me?</p> <p><em>Instead of turning around and showing me she begins to&nbsp;call for the manager.&nbsp; I don't understand why she doesn't just turn around and point it out to me if it is there.&nbsp; At this point the person behind me in line interjected.</em></p> <p><strong>Person behind me in line:</strong> It's under hamburgers.</p> <p>Finally!&nbsp; I then had to get the cashier to return her attention to me (she was still attempting to flag a manager) to place my order.&nbsp; Seriously, what's the deal?&nbsp; Is it really that cumbersome to ask the price of something?&nbsp;&nbsp; Shouldn't she know where the Kids meal is located on the menu?</p> <p>Anyway, I placed my order, got my food, ate, and left.&nbsp; At this point I don't think I will return to that Del Taco no matter what.&nbsp; From now on I'll drive the extra 2 miles for Taco Bell where the employees are pleastly brain dead but not rude.&nbsp; Besides Taco Bell is cheaper and better no matter what Dan tells you... <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/money/yourcounty/article_1586685.php">or used to tell you</a>.</p>

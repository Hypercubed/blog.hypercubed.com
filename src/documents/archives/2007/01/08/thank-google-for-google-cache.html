This happened to be a long post that I didn't feel like recreating. Now I could have gone onto my server and restored my database from my last backup but this should always be the last resort and who knows how longago teh last backup was done. First I turned to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/index.php">Wayback Machine</a> but for some reason they stopped archiving my blog in May or 2006. I guess they felt my blog was too lame? Anyway, my next step was Google. I did a search for Hypercubed plus some key words guaranteed to return a link to the now missing article. Underneath the appropriate link I clicked the "cache" link and there was a copy of my missing post in all it's <strike>glory</strike> Wayback Machine unworthiness. </p>

<p>About once a week I visit the McDonald's near my house.&nbsp; Invariably the conversation between myself and the cashier goes something like this: </p> <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="142" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/WindowsLiveWriter/McDonalds_DC09/image%7B0%7D%5B1%5D.png" width="180" align="right" border="0"><b>Me:</b>&nbsp; I'd like a Big Mac, sandwich only, and a large fries to go. <br><b>Cashier:</b> You want the large big mac combo? <br><b>Me:</b> No, just the sandwich and large fries. <br><b>Cashier:</b> Ok, anything to drink? <br><b>Me:</b> No. <br><b>Cashier:</b> Anything else? <br><b>Me:</b> No that is it. <br><b>Cashier:</b> Ok, for here or to go? <br><b>Me:</b> To go. </p> <p>What part of "I'd like a Big Mac, sandwich only, and a large fries to go." don't they understand? I guess everything other then "Big Mac" and "large". </p> <p>Even worse; once in a while a cashier tries to convince me that it is cheaper to get the combo.&nbsp; First of all I don't drink soda anymore so paying paying even a few cents extra is not worth it.&nbsp; Second it is NEVER cheaper to get the combo vs. the same sandwich and fries without the drink.&nbsp; Once every couple of months I need to prove this to a MCD cashier. If you ever look at your receipt after purchasing a combo meal you will see two entries.&nbsp; One is for the combo meal and the other for for the drink.&nbsp; They charge you full price for the drink and slightly less for the sandwich and fries.&nbsp; The savings never exceeds the cost of a drink.&nbsp; I suspect the reason behind this is that Coke is not going to get any less money for a soda just because you bought some fries with it. </p> <p>While I will feel slightly bad for the pimply faced high school students who won't be able to buy their PS3 on "their own money" I can't wait for <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/fast-food-selfservice-kiosks-coming-silicon-lifeforms-taking-over-world-219339.php">self serve kiosks</a>.&nbsp; Maybe in a few years I'll never need to talk to another human being ever again!&nbsp; I can dream can't I? </p>

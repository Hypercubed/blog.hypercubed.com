<p>(310) 807-5778.&nbsp; That's my number.&nbsp; Go ahead.. call me.&nbsp; I don't mind.&nbsp; Leave me complement or insult.&nbsp; Whatever you'd like.</p> <p><a href="http://grandcentral.com/"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="47" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/WindowsLiveWriter/CallMe_1070C/image%7B0%7D%5B4%5D.png" width="240" align="right" border="0"></a>&nbsp;Why on earth would I give my phone number for any freak and pervert to call me?&nbsp; No, it is not that I like receiving calls from freaks and perverts... at least not all the the time.&nbsp; It's because that number is my <a href="http://www.grandcentral.com/">GrandCentral</a> number.&nbsp; </p> <p>In case you haven't heard of GrandCentral let me explain.&nbsp; GrandCentral is a web app that lets you consolidate all of your phone numbers into one number.&nbsp; When someone calls your free GrandCentral number they hear a message indicating that your call is being connected.&nbsp; At the same time all your associated numbers (home, cell, work, etc) ring.&nbsp; You can pick up any of these phones to discover who is calling and decide to take the call, not take the call, or even screen the call.&nbsp; What is even better is you can setup custom call filters.&nbsp; You can&nbsp;have your wife's cell number&nbsp;routed to your work number, your mistress' home number&nbsp;can be routed to your cell, and telemarketers can be routed to hell (where they definitely belong).&nbsp; And if you desire, as I do, all unknown calls can be routed to voice mail.&nbsp; </p> <p>That's right.. if you call the above number and you are not on my contacts list you will be sent directly to voice mail. What's more with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~ttsweb/tts/demo.php">AT&amp;T Lab's Text-to-Speech Demo</a> you won't even know the sound of my voice.&nbsp; So go ahead... (310) 807-5778... I'd love to hear from you.... but please try to keep it clean.</p> <p>Now I just wish my number <a href="http://www.phonespell.org/">spelt something cool</a>.</p>

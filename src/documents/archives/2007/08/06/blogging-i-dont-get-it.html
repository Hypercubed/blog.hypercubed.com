<p>First <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> , then <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, followed quickly by <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>,&nbsp;and now <a href="www.pownce.com/">Pownce</a>.&nbsp; Micro-blogs are all over the place and&nbsp;frankly I just don't get it.&nbsp; For those of you that haven't heard of any of these; let me explain.&nbsp;These sites are like mini-blogs&nbsp;(or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging">micro-blogs</a>).&nbsp; The (micro-)blogger posts messages on a somewhat regular basis.&nbsp; But instead of a lengthy technical how-to or a long "my parents just don't understand" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo_(slang)">emo</a> rant they post short (mostly) useless updates like "getting milk at Ralph's" or "OMG, I just passed gas in church".&nbsp; Users can post these messages any time of day by mobile phone text message, instant messaging, email,&nbsp;or&nbsp;the website in an always&nbsp;connected mentality.&nbsp; Funny thing is even though this type of site appears <a href="http://marketingmonster.wordpress.com/2007/03/14/twitter-is-useless/">totally</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/aleksoft/twitter-the-useless-son-of-web-20">useless</a> to <a href="http://rajeev.name/blog/2007/03/12/a-useless-service-called-twitter/">everyone</a>, for some reason it is very popular.&nbsp; </p> <p>Why?&nbsp; I really don't know.&nbsp; Like I said I don't get it.&nbsp; Even though I like the idea of always being connected to the net (I want <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a> directly pumped into my head) I don't get the need to post every mundane activity.&nbsp; BTW, I ate at Jack-in-the-box tonight, wow, do you care?</p> <p>Stepping back a minute, how can I judge any of these sites without trying them?&nbsp; Maybe if I try it out I'll discover it is the best thing since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII art</a>.&nbsp; OK, I doubt it but&nbsp;I'll give one a try...&nbsp;only...&nbsp;which one?&nbsp; For me the choice was obviously <a href="www.pownce.com/">Pownce</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://www.pownce.com/">Pownce</a> is the latest, but probably not the last, micro-blogging platform to pop up in the web 2.0 "new world order".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pownce improved on the model by adding file, event, and link sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pownce is also <a href="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9739958-2.html">recommended</a>&nbsp;for use in a&nbsp;"work setting".&nbsp; While my blog is not really work (it is hard work, but I don't make money) I think Pownce is the site for me.&nbsp; Plus, I'm a big <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2005/05/25/goodbye-kevin-rose/">Kevin Rose</a> (a founder of <a href="http://www.pownce.com/">Pownce</a> and <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a>) fan so there you go.</p> <p>So if you want to see my Pownce micro-blog look here: <a href="http://pownce.com/hypercubed/">Hypercubed Pownce</a>.&nbsp; I also have a few invites.&nbsp; If you would like to join Pownce leave a comment below.&nbsp; Be sure to leave a valid e-mail in the e-mail field.&nbsp; Don't put your e-mail address in the comment if you want to avoid spam.</p>

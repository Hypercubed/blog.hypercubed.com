<p>If you read blogs at all you probably heard of <a href="http://www.reviewme.com/">ReviewMe</a> by now (maybe &nbsp;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/09/reviewme-launches-a-better-payperpost/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/reviewing-reviewme/">Here</a>, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/11/09/reviewme-launches-get-paid-to-review-products/">Or perhaps here</a>).&nbsp; There really is no need to me for explain what it is... but I will anyway... why?&nbsp; Because I need to write 200 words or more to get my cut of $25,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's right this blog post is bought and paid for... $30 to be exact.
</p>
<p><b>What is it?
  <br /></b>So, first of all what is <a href="http://www.reviewme.com/">ReviewMe</a>?&nbsp; ReviewMe is a pay per blog post advertising service.&nbsp; Like other pay per post services ReviewMe pays a commission to blogger that post on a particular topic.&nbsp; Unlike these other services ReviewME <i>requires</i> that the poster disclose that the post is sponsored and they do not require that the post is positive.&nbsp; Also unlike other such systems ReviewMe doesn't allow every blogger to post on every review topic.&nbsp; Instead ReviewMe has established a per post price for every blog (my post price is $60, I get $30).&nbsp; An advertiser can then decide if they want to pay that much to have a review written on that blog.&nbsp; The only requirement is that the post be 200 words or more.
</p>
<p><b>Is that ethical?
  <br /></b>Well, if you look to your right (my left) you will see a ads (if your screen width is &gt; 800 px).&nbsp; These ads generate some petty cash for me (very petty).&nbsp; So in a way this blog is already sponsored.&nbsp; Now you know that the ads on the right do not influence my posts so you are probably very comfortable with that.&nbsp; What about paid posts?&nbsp; Well, let's think about my type of blog for a moment.&nbsp; I don't blog that often.&nbsp; Most of my posts are the ever mediocre <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/categories/computers/internet/links-of-the-week/">links of the week</a>.&nbsp; Other then that I usually post about a&nbsp;my <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2006/09/30/xinha-here-v010/">programming projects</a>, a <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2006/09/17/how-to-dissuade-yourself-from-becoming-a-blogger/">blogging tip</a>, or a <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2005/11/25/turkeys-are-so-stupid/">skeptical rant</a>.&nbsp; Most of the posts I write do not drive repeat traffic.&nbsp; Visitors come to my site for one purpose and one posts.&nbsp; That means&nbsp;mostly only people seeking information on a particular topic visit my site.&nbsp; Most people will never see any of the sponsored posts unless they are specifically looking for information on that topic.
  <br />
</p>
<p>But also scattered around my blog are&nbsp;a <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2005/05/08/roboform-is-like-a-doorknob/">few</a> <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2005/05/18/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy/">product</a> <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2006/04/02/god-of-war/">reviews</a>.&nbsp; These posts usually contain an affiliation link.&nbsp; So if you click on the product I may earn some more petty cash (again not much).&nbsp; So in a fashion these posts are already bought, and bought very cheaply I might add.&nbsp; Do these posts influence my opinion?&nbsp; Obviously not otherwise my blog would be filled with them.
  <br />
</p>
<p>So the ethical question is should I accept sponsored posts of significant value?&nbsp; Is that ethical?&nbsp; Well, let's look around the world for a while.&nbsp; Sports stars are paid to sip the latest sports drink.&nbsp; All television shows have sponsors commercials.&nbsp; Just about every major Internet site has a&nbsp;high priced adverting deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; In all of these cases there is usually a high paid advertisement sales staff behind the deal.&nbsp; In my opinion ReviewMe is simply an advertising sales staff for the small time blogger.
</p>
<p><b>Will it work?
  <br /></b>Well, actually, I think it will not work for me and my blog.&nbsp; First of all ReviewMe requires the advertiser to find the blog.&nbsp; That means advertisers have to look though all the blogs on the ReviewMe site and for some reason feel that having a post on my blog is worth $60.&nbsp; Now lets say they do (silly them) and they offer to sponsor a post.&nbsp; I will not be writing any reviews unless I think I have something interesting to say... good or bad.&nbsp; I doubt I will&nbsp; receive many requests for reviews and if I do most will not be interesting to me.&nbsp; And believe me it has to be pretty interesting to get me to write 200 words.
</p>
<p>Another reason I think ReviewMe will not work is that the posts are not required to be positive.&nbsp; For me freedom to&nbsp;write negative reviews is a requirement for my participation.&nbsp; But if you are an advertisers looking for blogs to have review your product/service would you pay for a post on a blog with a history of bad reviews.&nbsp; I suspect most advertisers will not.&nbsp; I think pretty soon bloggers taht post bad reviews will find that they don't get offers.
  <br />
</p>
<p>So, I have signed up for ReviewMe.&nbsp; I'll collect my $30 for this post and see what happens.&nbsp; I'm not boking it in my monthly budget just yet.
</p>
<p>**is this 200 words already?**

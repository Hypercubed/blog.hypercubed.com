I'm not all that impressed.&nbsp; Looks like the main new features&nbsp;are&nbsp;all in appearance.&nbsp; That's not something I really care about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is the activation scheme that bothers me most.&nbsp; I won't go into details here because it has been <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=156">discussed</a> <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=166">many times</a> <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=158">elsewhere</a>.&nbsp; In addition I've never been a fan of the windows one licence per PC system.&nbsp; I'd much rather have a one licence per home system.&nbsp; Having three desktops&nbsp;and and a&nbsp;laptop at home it could be really expensive to upgrade all four machines.&nbsp; In I any event I thought it might be time to investigate alternatives to the MS products.</p> <p>I'm not a complete stranger to Linux/Unix.&nbsp; I've needed to access Unix systems every now and then (thank you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Harley%20Hahn&amp;tag=hypercubed-20&amp;index=books&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Harley Hahn</a>) and I occasionally run a <a href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/browserapp.html">browser appliance</a> under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware">VMWare</a>.&nbsp; So I'm not afraid of Linux but definitely not ready to fully commit.&nbsp; Therefore, I decided on a three phase approach to Linux migration.&nbsp; At each phase I'll deploy Linux in my life at increasing levels.&nbsp; At the end of each phase I'll decide based on my experience if I will implement the next phase or abandon the project.</p> <p>Phase I will be a complete install of Linux as a guest OS in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware">VMWare</a> on my Windows XP host.&nbsp; Like I said I do have a prebuilt Linux browser appliance under VMWare but that doesn't give the full experience.&nbsp; I want to install, upgrade, and maintain a full version of Linux.&nbsp; I will decide on a distribution, download the necessary ISO(s), and install it on a clean virtual hard drive.&nbsp; I'll then customize it as a I would a real system, install desired applications, and maybe even do some development work on it.&nbsp; I'll also be looking out for windows applications I need in order to fully integrate Linux in my life.</p> <p>In Phase II I will install Linux as the only OS on my laptop (currently running Win 2000).&nbsp; I don't use my laptop that often and when I do it is usually for accessing the Internet while on travel.&nbsp; I don't run any high end applications or games on my laptop so&nbsp;phase II should be an easy bet.</p> <p>In phase III I'll install Linux on my desktop PC as a dual boot option.&nbsp; I won't overwrite my current OS (Win XP) but add Linux as a secondary OS with the choice of OS to enter at boot time.&nbsp; This will be the ultimate test for Linux integration in my life.&nbsp; Will I be able to use Linux as my primary system or will I spend more time in Windows and allow Linux to go dormant?&nbsp; I'm not at all confident that I'll be able to reach phase III much less use it more often then windows.&nbsp; I have a lot of applications that I've accumulated over the years some of which I like very much.&nbsp; For example <a href="http://www.roboform.com/?affid=cubed">RoboForm</a>, <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a>, and <a href="http://www.imediaman.com/">MediaMan</a>&nbsp;all may be hard to find replacements for.&nbsp; Also, because I was once a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000BT7FRG%26tag=hypercubed-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000BT7FRG%253FSubscriptionId=0326XAEJHV9029HPZZ82">MSDN subscriber</a> I have a lot of&nbsp;MS software that I use all the time&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000KITOFE%26tag=hypercubed-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000KITOFE%253FSubscriptionId=0326XAEJHV9029HPZZ82">Visual Studio</a> for example).&nbsp; Also, I'm that type of person that likes to build custom applications whenever the need arises.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons that I want to switch to Linux but what about all my old applications... most of them built in Visual Basic.&nbsp; I don't want to recode all of them from scratch.&nbsp; On the other hand, most of my code these days is PHP in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> (cross platform IDE) and all my websurfing is through <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>&nbsp;so we will have to see.</p> <p>Well, as I write this I have already implemented some of phase.&nbsp; Full details of phase I will&nbsp;be in a later post.</p>

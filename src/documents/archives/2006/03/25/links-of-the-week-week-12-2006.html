  <li><a href="http://www.aeroseek.com/webtrax/">Aeroseek: Real-Time Flight Tracking</a> - At this site you can track, real time, commercial air flights.&nbsp; The really cool thing is once you find a flight click on the Google Earth button to see the tracking in <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>. 
  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.bigbluesaw.com/">Big Blue Saw - Home</a> - I stubbed upon this the other day.&nbsp; You visit the site, upload a cad drawing, pay some cash, and in 2 - 3 weeks you will receive the parts you designed in the mail. Really cool for prototyping and home brew products.&nbsp; It's pretty expensive if you are not ordering in large quantities but pretty cool.&nbsp; I hope their prices come down in the future... I have a few ideas.

  <li><a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/calcs/n_expect/main.asp">MSN Money - Life expectancy calculator</a> - Ok, we have all seen these life expectancy calculators before.&nbsp; I'm only linking because of the interesting result I got.&nbsp; My number 1 heath risk factor... being male.&nbsp; Great!&nbsp; Thanks a lot, I'll work on that. 
  </li> 
  <li><a href="http://weblog.timaltman.com/node/834">Reporting bugs to Microsoft | Stranger, yet...</a> - One of the main reason I like open source or small businesses software (as opposed to the Microsoft megaliths) is approachability.&nbsp; You have a problem with the software, just want to report a bug, or even worse try to request a feature don't even both trying to contact Microsoft.&nbsp; They are just simply too big to deal with you.

  <li><a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/">Ultimate Boot CD - Overview</a> - This is a bootable CD with several tools ready to run.&nbsp; I found this very useful when my HD crashed the other day.&nbsp; Although I wasn't able to recover any of the data off the drive I was able to verify that the drive was a total loss.&nbsp; It's also fairly easy to add non freeware applications like Norton Ghost and Partition Magic.

  <li><a href="http://www.current.tv/google/GC01041" title="via boingboing.net">Current TV // Google Current // Darth Tater</a> - I read boingboing.com very often.&nbsp; Mostly at night but sometimes during my lunch breaks at work... well not anymore.&nbsp; Boing Boing has been block at my work.&nbsp; It appears that <strike>Dumb</strike>SmartFilter has labeled boingboing.com a site containing nudity.&nbsp; This is a Google Current video newscast on what some call the erroneous blockage of boingboing.com.

  <li><a href="http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/">Ricardo Galli, de software libre - WP-Cache 2.0</a> - I was happy to see that version 2.0 of WP included a caching mechanism.&nbsp; However, what the built in caching mechanism does is cache the SQL calls to the database... a good first step.&nbsp; This WP plugin takes it on step further and caches entire pages.&nbsp; With this your wordpress site can be nearly efficient as a static site.&nbsp; Plus it gives a lot more control then the built in system.

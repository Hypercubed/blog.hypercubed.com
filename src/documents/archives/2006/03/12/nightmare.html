The worse day in a geeks life has to be when a hard drive crashes.  Well, that just happened to me.  I'm hoping I wake up in the morning and realize it was all a dream.  I'll log on to my blog in the morning form work just to see if this post is here... if so then it is real.

I really hate this.  It has happened to me once or twice before but often I'm able to pull the data off.  Not in this case.  The HD just makes a terrible clicking sound.  Strange thing is the hard drive was brand new.  I purchased it two months ago and transfered my entire file system over.  Luckily I still had the old one lying around and I made a backup of my data last month.  It will take me a while to figure out exactly what I'm missing.  Lesson here is to always keep backups.

<p>I was doing a little vanity googling this evening and I found something pretty humorous.&nbsp; I wound up at some guys website that has developed a <a href="http://hakore.com/f/html/">J2ME implementation of Tetris</a>.&nbsp; Take a look at his <a href="http://hakore.com/f/html/freeware.html">license agreement</a>.&nbsp; Second to last sentence of the first paragraph reads "Jayson Harshbarger retains title to and ownership in the copyright of the software program and the associated materials.".&nbsp; Wow, that is so nice.&nbsp; I've never met the guy be he has grated me title and ownership to his software!&nbsp; I sent him a short email requesting that he deliver all the software to me via FedEx.

<p>Of course this is a mistake.&nbsp; He apparently usurped my <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/freeware_license.php">Freeware License Agreement</a> and forgot to remove some of appearances of my name and website.&nbsp; The irony is that he is using my freeware license agreement to assert his copyright over his software while failing to recognize that my license agreement itself is my copy written work as clearly stated on <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/freeware_license.php">my website</a>.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; Well, if I was the recording industry or the motion picture industry I was sue the living hell out of him.&nbsp; But being the mild mannered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen">netizen</a> I simple sent a short e-mail:

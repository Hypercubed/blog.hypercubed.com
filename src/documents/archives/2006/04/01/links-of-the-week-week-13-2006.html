<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.startribune.com/462/story/335148.html">Boy gets caught in toy-filled 'claw' machine</a> - I know my son would have loved this.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://cookingbynumbers.com/frames.html">CookingByNumbers.com</a> - This is pretty useful.&nbsp; Here you can search for recipes based on your current stock of ingredients.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.danandsean.com/iamdrugs.htm">danANDsean.com</a> - Here are a few interesting illegal drug promotion videos. &nbsp; Yes, you read that right.&nbsp; They satirical pro-drug videos, pretty funny.

  <li><a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html">Find California Code</a> - I found this site very useful this week.&nbsp; Here you can search 29 California Law codes.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://finance.google.com/finance">Google Finance</a> - I don't know how long this has been around but I just discovered Google Finance.&nbsp; And it typical Google fashion they do a great job.&nbsp; The interactive stock charts are awesome... they just need to add some technical info, like 5-day average and such, and this would really rock.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.icbc.com/road_safety/tvadsPU.asp">ICBC - Insurance Corporation of British Columbia - Road Safety - CounterAttack TV ads</a> - Some very interesting anti-drunk driving ads. &nbsp;

  <li><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5307047">NPR : The Little Coffee Plant that Wouldn't Die</a> - I heard this story on the radio and had to really it.&nbsp; It is about a wild coffee plant that was believe to be extinct until a young biology student point out to his teach that he had one by his house.&nbsp; Far as anyone can tell that is the last one ever.&nbsp; The story discusses the twenty plus years of attempts to breed this rare plant.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/24/tuttle_centos/">Oklahoma city threatens to call FBI over 'renegade' Linux maker | The Register</a> - This is proof that some people should not be allowed online.&nbsp; When, due to a server misconfiguration, an Oklahoma city manager was presented with the boiler plate "Your server is now installed" web page he e-mailed the OS developers threating to call the FBI if they did not remove their software.&nbsp; Several hilarious (to us not involved) emails then flowed back and forth.

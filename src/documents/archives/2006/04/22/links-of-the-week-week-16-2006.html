Well, not many links this week. Which, in a way, is good.&nbsp; I'm too preoccupied with other projects to comment on any more.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1841989&amp;page=1">ABC News: Exxon Chairman Gets $400 Million Retirement Package Amid Soaring Gas Prices</a> - I really don't understand why corporations pay executives so much. During the boom days executives were being paid well because the companies were making lots of money (in general due more to economics then good executive skills), then during the downturn they were paid even more for keeping the companies afloat. While the employees, that do the real work for the companies, saw decreases in pay and layoffs CEO salaries continued to increase. In 2005, the average CEO was paid almost $430 for every $1 in the average workersâ€™ paycheck. And that is just the salaries. What about all the perks: company car, parking spot closer then the handicap, and alcohol budgets? I don't get it.

  <li><a href="http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/index.htm">ANOTHER WORLD - Site officiel</a> - A long time ago, before EBGames and such, I was browsing through a pawn shop. In one corner there was a stack of used Nintendo and Super Nintendo games for sale.&nbsp; One of which was titled Another World. I never heard of it but for $5 I couldn't go wrong. I bought the game and it turned into my favorite Super Nintendo game. I know that is not saying much considering that the Super Nintendo kind of sucked in general but this was really one of my all time favorite games. I was stuck in one section of the game for a horribly long time (maybe a year if I recall) which was very frustrating. I would have looked for a hint online but this was before I (or most of the population) had online access.

  <li><a href="http://strategywiki.net/wiki/Main_Page">Main Page - StrategyWiki</a> - Well now that we are all online; strategy guides can be found all over the place. These are often very long text files that the author spent a great deal of time compiling. With this strategy wiki individuals, can contribute a piece at a time and avoid duplicating work. This has the potential to become a great resource.

  <li><a href="http://www.digital.udk-berlin.de/en/projects/winter0405/main/hauptprojekt/snoil.html">A display based on ferrofluids</a> - Very cool but also creepy game made out of a ferrofluid (imagine a magnetic liquid).
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.random-good-stuff.com/random_good_stuff/2006/04/guess_what_it_i.html">Random Good Stuff: Guess what it is and get $15</a> - Can you guess what this is? I thought it might be a Manta Ray air bladder; but apparently manta rays, like sharks, use an <a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/sharks/rays/">oily liver to maintain buoyancy</a> (could that be it?).

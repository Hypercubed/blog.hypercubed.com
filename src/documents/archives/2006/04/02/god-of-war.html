I do like video games and play a few but it is very rare for me to finish a game. I typically buy a game and play until it gets boring (read repetitive and redundant). It takes a lot for me to stay interested in a game. I think the last game I played to conclusion was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hypercubed-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B0000696CZ%2526tag=hypercubed-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B0000696CZ%25253FSubscriptionId=0326XAEJHV9029HPZZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a> and before that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hypercubed-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005ME8S%2526tag=hypercubed-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005ME8S%25253FSubscriptionId=0326XAEJHV9029HPZZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Half-Life</a>. Well, the other night I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002XL3BA/hypercubed-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;adid=1889KD8RTY14QC6N4W4G&amp;link_code=as1">God or War</a>. I don't think it is news that God of War is a great game. It has won <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War#Awards">tons of awards</a> including several game of the year awards. What is interesting about God of War is the price.&nbsp; I typically wait for games to drop in price before I buy a copy.&nbsp; Considering my poor commitment to finishing games this seams like a good plan.&nbsp; However, the price for God of War stayed high for a long time.&nbsp; I presume because it it's immense popularity.&nbsp; I was watching and the price was just not dropping.&nbsp; Well, a couple of weeks ago they released a new "Greatest Hits" printing with a new price of $19.95.&nbsp; Wow! I've never seen a price drop so suddenly. Needless to say I snagged a copy and spent most of my free time playing.&nbsp; Not only did I finish the game but in record time (for me that is).&nbsp; Great game... highly recommended for Mature (17+) game players.&nbsp; Defiantly not a game for the young ones.

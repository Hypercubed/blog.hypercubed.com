<p>So as a WordPress fan I've been hearing a lot about <a href="http://automattic.com/code/widgets/">Widgets</a> these days. What are widgets?&nbsp; Well if you look to the right side of my blog you will several items running vertically down the page.&nbsp; This is the side bar.&nbsp; You will notice that the side bar is made up of discrete segments.&nbsp; Normally these segments are setup by hand in the WP template system.&nbsp; What the widgets plugin does is provide a system where each items is a separate entity and the side bar can be arranged and rearranged by dragging and dropping the widget elements.&nbsp; The end result is the same look to the website visitors but a much easier time on the developers end maintaining the side bar.&nbsp; New plugins will start coming along that are widgetizid.&nbsp; That is the plugin will come with a prepackaged widget that can be added to the sidebar with a simple drag and drop.&nbsp; That is the great thing about WP... while you can make a website all by hand the templating and plugin system makes it a easy to avoid coding all together.

<p>So with all this talk I've been hearing about Widgets yesterday I decided to give it a try.&nbsp; The new <a href="http://automattic.com/code/widgets/">widgets</a> plugin is available from <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting up involves uploading the plugin, activating the plugin, and modifying your theme.&nbsp; The <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> website has details on this so I won't go into them here.&nbsp; Next you have to setup the individual widgets.&nbsp; You can drag and drop several preexisting widgets to the sidebar but I found they don't fully suit my needs.&nbsp; For example, the links widget is an all or nothing thing.&nbsp; That is, if you place the links widget in your sidebar you will get a list of all links across all categories.&nbsp; There's no option to select which categories to display.&nbsp; But that is the great thing about using widgets; all you need to do is find where someone has made a widget that suits your needs.&nbsp; So a little searching turned up the <a href="http://moho.optera.net/projects/wordpress/linkblock/">Linkblock widget</a>.&nbsp; With this you can add individual link categories to the sidebar.&nbsp; That helped a lot but still not perfect.&nbsp; Some of my links (for example blogs) are not displayed in the default way.&nbsp; Linkblock widget will display the links for a single category in the default manner for that category.&nbsp; On my side bar I manipulate the links call in to modify what links are returned; for example to limit the number of links or modify the sort order.&nbsp; So for these cases I needed the <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2006/04/09/fun-with-widgets/">ExecPHP widget</a>.&nbsp; This allows me to execute PHP code from within a widget.&nbsp; With this plugin I was able to get the side bar looking almost exactly the way I wanted with the added advantage of easy manipulation on my end.
</p>
<p>Overall I think the widgets plugin is a great addition to the WP system and I hope they eventually include it in the WP core.&nbsp; One improvement I'd like to see is the ability to name the widgets inside the widget drag and drop system.&nbsp; It can be difficult to arrange widgets if they all have generic names like "Text 1", "Text 2", etc.&nbsp; I also hope someone improves on the Linkbot widgets (or the default links widget).

  <li><a href="http://www.indwes.edu/tuesday/speed.htm">SPEED</a> - I don't know if I mentioned this before but my reading speed is embarrassing.&nbsp; I took a speed reading course my first year in college but it didn't help much.&nbsp; The speed reading technique revolves around reducing verbalization.&nbsp; Basically stop reading the words in your head and take in the entire sentence at once.&nbsp; I could never do it and still have any recall of what I read.

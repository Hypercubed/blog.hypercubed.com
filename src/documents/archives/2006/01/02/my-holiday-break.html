At work we get the week between Christmas and new years off.&nbsp; Upon returning to work all conversation seam to start with "So what did you do over break?".&nbsp; I then have to listen to my co-workers rattle on about their trips Vegas, Tahiti vacations, wild New Years parties.&nbsp; Me, my answer is typically: "nothing" and this year will be no different.&nbsp; That's right I didn't go anywhere or do anything exciting.&nbsp; But spending free time at home away from work is still productive and while I always answer that "what did you do over break" question with "nothing" the truth is I did a lot... just not very interesting to my co-workers (or really anyone besides myself).
<p> So in case anyone is interested (I'm sure your not) here is a breakdown of my holiday activities.&nbsp; Think of it as a week in retrospect to contracts all the year in review posts going around.

</p>
<p>I gave my wife a Christmas gift from <a href="http://www.eluxury.com/">eLuxury.com</a>, something I thought she world really like.&nbsp; eLuxery.com, in case you didn't know, is the only official Louis Vuitton online vendor in North America.&nbsp; I did my research... all those online stores claiming to be selling authentic LV at half the price are fake.&nbsp; Surprisingly some of the sites selling fake LV products were very well made... just goes to show you in these days you can no longer trust a company by their website.&nbsp; Well, anyway I purchased an authentic LV product and gave it to my wife.&nbsp; Soon after giving it too her I filled out the forms and made a trip to the post office to return said Christmas gift.&nbsp; Some people are never pleased.&nbsp; I gave my son <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hypercubed-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00080VMMW%2526tag=hypercubed-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00080VMMW%25253FSubscriptionId=0326XAEJHV9029HPZZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">a talking pooh bear</a> that appears to have problems telling time.&nbsp; He has a tendency to say "I do love dinner" at 2am.&nbsp; Two strikes this Christmas.
  <br />
</p>
<p> I installed <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress 2.0</a>.&nbsp; I was initially upset when I discovered it was <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/index.php/archives/2005/12/26/wordpress-20/">broken</a>.&nbsp; Luckily after spending few minutes I managed to <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/index.php/archives/2005/12/26/wordpress-20-fix/">fix it</a> and submitted a <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1917">bug report and had my fix incorporated into the WordPress core</a>.&nbsp; I also modified the WordPress core files to make the post preview optional.&nbsp; I only look at the post preview a few times why do I need to waste bandwidth and server time on something I'm not using.&nbsp; I was hoping I could make this into a plugin but I don't see any easy way to do that so I submitted it as a <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2200">feature request</a>.
  <br />
</p>
<p>I posted my fix to the WordPress bug <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/index.php/archives/2005/12/26/wordpress-20-%0A%0Afix/">here</a> so I can help others having the same issue but not willing to search the official bug database.  I didn't like the way the php code looked so I modified an existing WordPress plugin to use the <a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/">GeSHi Generic Syntax Highlighter</a> to provide syntax highlighting.&nbsp; I was tempted to use the <a href="http://blog.igeek.info/still-fresh/2005/07/05/worming-my-way-out/">iG:Syntax Hiliter</a> but I wanted more control and besides it is not yet <a href="http://blog.igeek.info/still-fresh/2005/12/27/igsyntax-hiliter-incompatibility/">compatible with WordPress 2.0</a>.&nbsp; If I'm satisfied with this final product I may release it publicly.
</p>
<p>I went to FilePlanet to sign up for the free <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/158404/150000/fileinfo/World-of-Warcraft-Trial-%5BFull-Client%5D">trail</a>.&nbsp; Spent 20 minutes signing up for a fileplant account.&nbsp; 50 minutes waiting in the download queue to start&nbsp; downloading.&nbsp; Left the room for a few hours (at least two) while the file was transferring.&nbsp; Spent 10 minutes unziping the files, 20 minutes installing, and 30 minutes creating a World of Warcraft account (cumulative time so far: 4+ hours).&nbsp; Then I proceeded to spend the next 30 minutes getting bored with the game.&nbsp; Amazingly I spent another 6 hours or so forcing myself to play more so I can discover what all the hype was about.&nbsp; Answer: 3 minute gryphon rides across the <span>skies of Azeroth make it all worth it (well it was free).</span>

<p>I worked on my <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">Xinha Here Firefox</a> extension.&nbsp; I added the ability to open Xinha in a sidebar or a bottom bar.&nbsp; I'm still working on a few issues with missing context menus so it hasn't been posted yet.&nbsp; I posted a <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?%0A%0At=360704&amp;highlight=">detailed description</a> of my issues to the MozillaZine forum through which I <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=349715&amp;highlight=">never have received any help</a>. I also added some extra features like recovery of previous text and saving and loading the HTML from a file.&nbsp; These are both features that can only work because Xinha Here is running in a privileged mode in your browser.&nbsp; Any other ideas out there?
</p>
<p>In response to a <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/megabbs/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=118&amp;posts=6#M488">post to my forum</a> that Xinha Here did not work in Firefox 1.5 on Linux I installed <abbr title="Firefox">FF</abbr> 1.5 in my <a href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/vm/browserapp.html">browser appliance virtual machine</a> thanks the the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion">instructions here</a>.&nbsp; I was pleased that everything seams to run fin in FF 1.5 on Linux.&nbsp; Turns out there was an issue with the users browser not Xinha Here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Modified my <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/fx_install.asp?url=url_here&amp;title=Title%20Here%20v0.0">Firefox installation page</a> to make it more clear that you need to add hypercubed.com to the allowed domains list.&nbsp; Hopefully this will cut off some of the "can't install your extension" e-mails.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it lead to one "I can't download your extension at all" email that made me realize I broke the link to the extension.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; It is amazing that I can receive so much traffic but nobody reports this error for 24 hours.

<p> Had my server go down in the middle of drafting this post.&nbsp; Requiring me to start all over but giving me the great idea for an auto-recovery feature for future versions of Xinha Here. What's that phrase "<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/3/necessityist.html">necessity is the mother of invention</a>"?&nbsp; Everything I make is because I need it.&nbsp; That is what distinguishes me from a professional programmer.&nbsp; Which in turn means that I will never make any money.&nbsp; By the way the amount of money that I have earned through PayPal donations and advertisement revenue for Xinha Here: $2... thank you Filip!
</p>
<p>I was very unhappy to be late on my last links of the week for the year thanks to above mentioned server issues.
</p>
<p>So I think you will agree that while I did many things during the break the most appropriate answer is still... "nothing".  Maybe for a lucky few they will get "read my blog".

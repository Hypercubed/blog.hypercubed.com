<p>I recently had the pleasure of participating in <a href="http://www.sugarsync.com/">SugarSync</a> beta.&#160; The beta is now finished and anyone can signup for a 45 day trial.&#160; Today is the last day of my trial.&#160; While testing SugarSync I can't help but compare it to my current online backup solution, <a title="You shouldn&#39;t have to think about backup." href="http://www.mozy.com/?kbid=31195">Mozy</a>.&#160; Comparing SugarSync and Mozy really isn't fair.&#160; SugarSync, as the name implies, is a syncing program.&#160; Mozy, on the other hand, is an off-site backup solution.&#160; However, because SugarSync copies your files to their website it also serves as a backup solution.&#160; I suspect many people are using it this way.</p>  <p><strong>What's the same?</strong></p>  <p>With both Mozy and SugarSync you install an application on your desktop, select which folders you want to backup/sync, and let it go.&#160; Both programs then monitor the folders you specified and uploads changes to the website.&#160; With either application you can download the files either through the application or online.</p>  <p><strong>What makes SugarSync better?</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://www.sugarsync.com/" class="img"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="60" alt="image" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/image.png" width="214" align="right" border="0" /></a>Mozy offers unlimited backup for $4.95 a month.&#160; For the same price on SugarSync you get 30 GB which for most people is plenty and practically speaking all I would every imagine uploading to Mozy in its current state.&#160; The truth with Mozy is that once I got above a few GB it became painfully slow index and upload files.&#160; Now your mileage may very.&#160; The files I'm backing up to Mozy are actually periodically copied from my main drive to my backup drive before being scanned and uploaded (see <a href="http://blog.hypercubed.com/archives/2007/07/16/backup-strategy/">Backup Strategy</a>).&#160; That means many files are changed all at once not one at a time over many days as Mozy expects.&#160; It takes Mozy a long time to sort out what files have changed and several days to upload all these files.&#160; SugarSync doesn't appear to have this problem at least during the limited beta when traffic was likely low.&#160; Now I haven't done any intensive benchmarking so I can't say for sure but files appear to be sorted and uploaded to SugarSync rather quickly.&#160; Even if the speed wasn't an issue the SugarSync application shows me what files have been uploaded and which are pending.&#160; It really eases the mind to know which files are safe and which are not.</p>  <p>Understandably because Mozy's service is for unlimited space they restrict you to one computer.&#160; That is not the case with SugarSync.&#160; After all it's main purpose is Syncing.&#160; With SugarSync you can install the application on multiple computers, they can all upload to the same account.&#160; They can even be setup to keep certain directories in sync across computers (hence the name).</p>  <p>Probably one of the best things about SugarSync is its 'web 2.0' website.&#160; On the website you can view, download, and update files in your file set&#160; If you update the files online they are also updated on your computer next time that computer syncs.&#160; This is really great if you need to work on a file while on the road.&#160; With Mozy you can download the backup through their 'web 1.0' website but that is it.&#160; In addition to the website SugarSync has a <a href="http://www.sugarsync.com/downloads/winmo.html">mobile windows client</a> that can view images in your backup and sync your mobile photos.&#160; You can also visit the <a href="https://m.sugarsync.com/login">mobile version</a> or iphone version of the website to download other files.</p>  <p><strong>Why I'm (reluctantly) sticking with Mozy.</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://www.mozy.com/?kbid=31195" class="img"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="52" alt="image" src="http://blog.hypercubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/image1.png" width="206" align="right" border="0" /></a> With all this great sweetness with SugarSync (pun intended) it has one serious flaw.&#160; SugarSync lacks file versions.&#160; Imagine that you have a very important word document.&#160; One day you may open this word document and discover that all the images are replaced with big red 'X's.&#160; This happened to me in the past with a few large word docs.&#160; The file is corrupted, you need to restore it.&#160; If you then restore this file from SugarSync you will discover that it has the same problem.&#160; SugarSync has &quot;backed up&quot; your corrupted word document over your good version.&#160; Unless you keep another backup somewhere else on your files system you are screwed.&#160; But isn't that the point of a backup system, so you don't have to do it manually.&#160; With Mozy you can restore one of the previous versions before the corruption took hold.&#160; Ultimately, I think this makes SugarSync practically unusable as a backup system.&#160; But, as I said before SugarSync is not really intended to be a backup solution. </p>  <p><strong>What I'd like to see.</strong></p>  <p>I really like SugarSync.&#160; I'm tempted to use SugarSync and Mozy together as a Sync/Backup tag team but $25 a year for SugarSync and $50 a year for Mozy I can't justify it.&#160; If SugarSync had a cheap (or free) low GB version I might continue to use it for essential files that I need to access on other computers.&#160; Instead, for now, I will use <a href="http://box.net/">Box.net</a> for that and Mozy for backup.</p>  <p>Now with that said I think SugarSync has a lot of room to grow.&#160; It feels to me that Mozy is basically use-as-is software for the foreseeable future while SugarSync is actively pursuing improvements.&#160; If they added file versions I'd jump ship today.&#160; I have a couple of other ideas that would make it the ultimate backup/syncing/mobile documents solution.&#160; </p>  <p>When storing files &quot;in the cloud&quot; security is a serious concern.&#160; SugarSync has robust security in place on their servers but what about on the users end?&#160; If you need to access a file while on the road you may be logging in on a uncontrolled desktop in a cyber cafe or maybe an open wi-fi hotspot.&#160; In this situation your password my be sniffed or key-logged.&#160; With so much of your personal data online this can be disastrous.&#160; I'd like to see a mechanism of protecting against this either with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token">security token</a> or perhaps restricted throw-away logins that can only access files you have deemed accessible while on the road.&#160; I don't see anyone doing this at this time but it is necessary if we are to feel comfortable keep private data online.</p>  <p>Since I don't want to use SugarSync &quot;on the road&quot; I use Box.net.&#160; Box.net has what they call <a href="http://www.box.net/info/openbox">OpenBox services</a>.&#160; Files uploaded to your box.net account can be viewed and edited online using any number of online services including <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> (office documents) and <a href="http://www.picnik.com/">Picnik</a> (image editing).&#160; I'd like to see this type of services added to SugarSync.&#160; If SugarSync is going to become my one stop shop for online file storage this is a must.&#160; Or how about using the OpenBox platform to sync a SugarSync folder with box.net?&#160; That would be cool.</p>  <p><strong>Thank you, goodnight.</strong></p>  <p>If someone from Sharpcast (makers of SugarSync) see this I want to thank you for allowing me to participate in your beta.&#160; I look forward to seeing where you go from here.</p>

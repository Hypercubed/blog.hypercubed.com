<p>While preparing <a href="http://www.hypercubed.com/projects/firefox/">Xinha Here!</a> for the forthcoming release of <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_3_for_developers">Firefox 3.0</a> I got the idea of adding the capability to drag and drop HTML text from the browser into the Xinha editor.&#160; While trying to figure out the best way to do this I discovered, to my amazement, that Xinha Here already does this.&#160; As long as your cursor is in the editor you can drag and drop text and images into the editor to paste all the associated HTML including absolute URLs.</p>
